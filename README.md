# Discrete_Mathematics_and_Algorithm
CRLS and Discrete_Mathematicsand_Its_Applications book notes
# How I chose the textbooks
- from [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#algorithms), the 2 books it recommends don't have full solutions for corresponding exercises (1. [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.algorist.com/algowiki/index.php/Solution_Wiki,_The_Algorithm_Design_Manual,_3rd_Edition) 2. MIT related book [2015](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/resources/mit6_042js15_textbook/) or [github](https://github.com/spamegg1/Math-for-CS-solutions/blob/master/inclass-questions/MIT6_042JS15_cp3_solutions.pdf)).
  - So I chose Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2312/1059606) with full [solutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/textbookrequest/comments/qdoxej/comment/i80ryh5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
    - after all, this [not well known](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/207486/a-good-introductory-discrete-mathematics-book#comment529252_207515) book may be also well.
    - Also many recommend [Discrete Mathematics with Applications](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/207527/1059606).
    - Also see this [comparison](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1930644/1059606) among them.
  - and CRLS 4th with almost [full 3rd solutions](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ajl213/CLRS/CLRS.html) although teachyourselfcs doesn't recommend for the complexity.
    - sol
      - [1](https://clrs.skanev.com/)
      - [3rd Instructor’s Manual](https://community.wvu.edu/~krsubramani/courses/backupcourses/CS520Fa2013/CormenSolutions/9780262033848-Instructors.pdf)
      - [3rd solution list](https://atekihcan.github.io/CLRS/foreword/)
        they are less detailed than [wojtask](https://github.com/wojtask/clrs4e-solutions) (See 1.1 answers)
    - it is enough to read it to [cover](https://qr.ae/pKA9wQ) the "data structures" although [too serious](https://qr.ae/pKA9b0).
- More detailed see [this](https://github.com/czg-sci-42ver/csapp3e/blob/master/asm/README.md#algorithms-and-data-structures) related contexts.
- I didn't use Algorithms, Fourth Edition by Sedgewick referred to in teachyourselfcs although it has one [full solution](https://github.com/reneargento/algorithms-sedgewick-wayne/tree/master/src/chapter1/section1) (This is [not full](https://github.com/aistrate/AlgorithmsSedgewick/tree/master/1-Fundamentals/1-1-BasicProgModel)) due to 
  1. it is based on Java including Web Exercises / programming exercises. Although there are [other versions of solutions](https://forum.codeselfstudy.com/t/algorithms-4th-edition-sedgewick-wayne/25/13), pseudocode may be more appropriate for others to learn.
  2. It is published in 2011 which may be inappropriate in 2024.
  3. It cares about testing instead of strict mathematical proof
    > then *testing the hypotheses* by running the algorithms in realistic contexts.
    > The emphasis is on testing algorithms in the context of *meaningful applications*.
    - This is also implied by
      > Do I need any special mathematical background? No, we assume only a basic high school background.
      So it doesn't even need calculus? (CRLS also needs linear algebra) 
  - Notice 3rd may be different from the 4th.
    > Sedgewick’s Algorithms in C/C++/Java, Third Edition is more appropriate as a reference or a text for an advanced course

          > For instance, one thing that disappoints me about CLRS is that in covering dynamic programming, it *doesn’t emphasize enough that the secret sauce* comes from thinking about problems recursively.

          > But that’s because I *already have a big picture* framework in my head. If I wanted to learn how to think about algorithms, having never studied the subject before, CLRS would not be my first choice of a textbook.

# How to read these books
- We should *read the appendix first* as the order of 'Eighth Edition SOLUTIONS' although when reading 'Discrete Mathematics with Applications' I read the main part first. See [this appendix of one different book](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/class/cs/csse474/201940/MiscellaneousDocuments/OverviewOfAppendixTopics.pdf) got by "Should I read appendix of the "textbook" first".
  Although for novels it's [not recommended to read the appendix first](https://www.reddit.com/r/dune/comments/15qbd5m/comment/jw260vo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).
- Since I have one book as the main book and the other as the complement, it is better to *read them at the same time*. Since reading the other book after having read one book, some contents have been learnt are blurred and it took some *unnecessary time to review* them.
- Notice to *read errata*.
