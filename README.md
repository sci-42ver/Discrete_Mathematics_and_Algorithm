# Discrete_Mathematics_and_Algorithm
CRLS and Discrete_Mathematicsand_Its_Applications book notes
# How I chose the textbooks
- from [teachyourselfcs](https://teachyourselfcs.com/#algorithms), the 2 books it recommends don't have full solutions for corresponding exercises (1. [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.algorist.com/algowiki/index.php/Solution_Wiki,_The_Algorithm_Design_Manual,_3rd_Edition) 2. MIT related book [2015](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/resources/mit6_042js15_textbook/) or [github](https://github.com/spamegg1/Math-for-CS-solutions/blob/master/inclass-questions/MIT6_042JS15_cp3_solutions.pdf)).
  - So I chose Discrete Mathematics and its Applications by [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2312/1059606) with full [solutions](https://www.reddit.com/r/textbookrequest/comments/qdoxej/comment/i80ryh5/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)
    - after all, this [not well known](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/207486/a-good-introductory-discrete-mathematics-book#comment529252_207515) book may be also well.
    - Also many recommend [Discrete Mathematics with Applications](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/207527/1059606).
    - Also see this [comparison](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1930644/1059606) among them.
  - and CRLS 4th with almost [full 3rd solutions](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~ajl213/CLRS/CLRS.html) although teachyourselfcs doesn't recommend for the complexity.
    - it is enough to read it to [cover](https://qr.ae/pKA9wQ) the "data structures" although [too serious](https://qr.ae/pKA9b0).
- More detailed see [this](https://github.com/czg-sci-42ver/csapp3e/blob/master/asm/README.md#algorithms-and-data-structures) related contexts.

# How to read these books
- We should read the appendix first as the order of 'Eighth Edition SOLUTIONS' although when reading 'Discrete Mathematics with Applications' I read the main part first.
