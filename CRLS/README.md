## [online resources](https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262046305/introduction-to-algorithms/)
- Pseudocode and Figures as PDFs is *already contained* in the book
- "Materials Removed from 3e" are ~~*skipped*~~ partly dropped See page xvii
  - I *may* check
    1. implementing pointers and objects
    2. perfect hashing
    3. push-relabel  algorithms  for  maximum  체ow
    4. iterative fast Fourier transform method
    5. the details of the simplex algorithm for linear  programming
    6. integer  factorization
- "Khan Academy Course" is *skipped* because they are much incomplete.
- "CLRS code.pdf" is for latex package.
- *TODO
  - ~~I didn't~~ read ["Professor Jokes Explained"](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/4e-professor-jokes.html)
  - see [Introduction to Algorithms OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-046j-introduction-to-algorithms-sma-5503-fall-2005/) although they are for the 2nd version book
  - ~~use "Python Code".~~
    > If you wish to implement any of the algorithms, you should 청nd the transla-tion of our pseudocode into your favorite programming language to be a *fairly straightforward* task.

## preface
- > The chapter notes, bibliography, and index were updated, re체ecting  the  dra-matic growth of the 청eld of algorithms since the third edition.
  from 2009 to 2022
- > Those that were reported while we were in full swing preparing this edition were not posted, but were corrected in this edition.
  i.e. in errata TODO
- > Chapter 4 underwent substantial  changes to improve its mathematical founda-tion and make it more robust and intuitive
  TODO how "robust"? and other page xvii~ list.
# The Algorithm Design Manual
- from [course page](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/)
  - maybe part 1 is [enough](https://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~skiena/373/syllabus.pdf)
    - It is for the undergraduate course
      > There should not be any CS graduate students taking this course, and likely none from any department

- TODO
  - How to access "Thomson Reuters Book Citation Index" [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_Citation_Index#References) [2](https://www.igi-global.com/newsroom/archive/thomson-reuters-indexes-igi-global/1536/)
- > require only black and white, and are under 275 pages, Springer offers the flexibly designed Undergraduate Topics in Computer Science series,
  [see](https://dblp.org/db/series/utcs/index.html) 
  they are not all under 275 like [1](https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/978-3-319-09888-3) [2](https://sci-hub.se/10.1007/978-3-030-39357-1)
