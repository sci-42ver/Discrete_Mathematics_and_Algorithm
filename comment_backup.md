<span class="comment-copy">Sorry, @Vass, it's not always easy to guess the background of others. $G$ is a group whose order $\varphi(n)$ is divisible by the prime $r$. Then by Cauchy's theorem <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_theorem_%28group_theory%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%27s_theorem_%28group_theory%29</a> there is in $G$ an element $x$ of order $r$, so $x \ne 1$ and $x^{r} = 1$. Since $r$ also divides $e$, there is $k$ such that $e = r k$. Thus $x^{e} = x^{r k} = (x^{r})^{k} = 1^{k} = 1$.</span>

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/285134/can-a-recurrence-relation-have-more-than-one-exact-solution#comment10285188_285134
<span class="comment-copy">Your question has some small problems with its description IMHO. 1. If caring about  "more than one exact solution", then the answer is "Yes". Notice here the recurrence relation doesn't need to have initial terms as this <a href="https://redirect.cs.umbc.edu/~nikbar1/Lectures203/Lecture11_3-8" rel="nofollow noreferrer">lecture p2</a> says, so we can have multiple (exact) solutions. 2. If caring about "more than one general solution", then as Jonathan Christensen's answer says, it is "No".</span>

Cameronin in <a href="http://vlsicad.eecs.umich.edu/BK/SAUCY/papers/Cameron2001.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer">"Automorphisms of Graphs"</a> says: This simple definition does not suffice for multigraphs; we need to specify a permutation of the edges as well as a permutation of the vertices, to ensure that the multiplicity of edges between two vertices is preserved. (Alternatively, a multigraph can be regarded as a weighted graph [...] This gives a slightly different description of automorphisms, but the action on the set of vertices is the same.) We will consider only simple graphs here.</span>

<span class="comment-copy">Here I offer my understanding of this answer if someone is one newbie as me when I read this post. This post has one specific <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/a/752184/1059606">application</a> with one specific example. 1. $\frac{a_m}{(z - \rho)^m} + \dotsb + \frac{a_1}{z - \rho}$ is due to: in the characteristic equation $r^k-c_1 r^{k-1}-\cdots-c_k=0$, divide both sides by $r^k$, then $z=r^{-1}$, so the repeated root $b$ in $(x-b)^t$ means $\rho=b^{-1}$. Then the above has $\rho^{-n}$ in its final equation of $a_n$.</span>

If the original graph $G$ has one cycle $C$. Then take arbitrary 2 adjacent vertices $v,w$ (we can also take one pair not adjacent. For simplicity, I assume adjacent) inside this cycle. Then 2 cycles are created. One is the multiedge $(v,w)$, while the other is $C-\{v,w\}+\{v,w\}^{(*)}$ where the superscript $(*)$ shows whether the edge is in the original graph. This is contradiction. So $G$ is acyclic.</span>
