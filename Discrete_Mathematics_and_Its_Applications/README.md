  > The heart of Aristotle's logic is the syllogism, the classic example of which is as follows
- "p only if q" means only if q is true, p can be true.
- compare TABLE 5 and TABLE 6, the $p\leftrightarrow q$ changes one `F` to `T`.
### 1.2

    i.e. either the 1st win or the 2nd.
    Then
    > instead of eating just the cookie in the bottom right corner, the first player could have made the same move that the second player made as the first move of a winning strategy
    the 1st can use the strategy of the 2nd to replace the 2nd, then win.
    - > , the proof is a nonconstructive existence proof. In fact, no one has been able to describe a winning strategy for Chomp that applies for all rectangular grids by describing the moves that the first player should follow

  - it is the general case of [Boolean algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra#Values).
    - See example 10 "De Morgan’s law for propositions" for how this generalization works based on using the property, i.e. [Set-builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Set-builder_notation), as the *proposition* ~~in some way~~.
      then $\notin$ becomes $\overline{A}$, etc, to convert *back* to the set theory.
    - The use the *equivalence of proposition* $\equiv$ to prove the $\leftarrow$ if having proven $\rightarrow$.
  - example 11 just uses the $\equiv$ implicitly.
### 2.3
- p170 function definition implies no one-to-mul and part-to-total/part (i.e. must total-to-...). <a id="default_total_function"></a>
  “one-to-one” means not mul-to-one, i.e. if *only use one in the domain*, then *no redundancy* in the *domain*.
  "onto" means no redundancy in the *codomain*, i.e. no total-to-part.
- > A one-to-one correspondence is called invertible

  ~~only needs one-to-one to make "invertible" possible.~~
  - one-to-one due to above p170 definition where $a$ as $f^{-1}$
    image needs to be *unique* for each $b$. -> " more than one such a"
  - onto due to "each element of A" which applying to $f^{-1}$ means "each element of B" in p170
    so no part-to-total
    -> "no such a"
- Stirling's approximation proof

  - [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation#Alternative_derivations)
    - [Laplace's method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_method#Formal_statement_and_proof) applied for $M=n,f(x)=lnx-x$
      1. $f'(x)=\frac{1}{x}-1,x>0$ so $f(1)=max$ which implies $f''(x)<0$
      - in [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_method#General_theory_of_Laplace's_method), inspired by "Formal statement and proof",
        ${\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}e^{Mf(x)}\,dx\approx {\sqrt {\frac {2\pi }{M|f''(x_{0})|}}}e^{Mf(x_{0})}{\text{ as }}M\to \infty .}$
        is due to:
        by using $y=\sqrt{M|f''(x_0)|}(x-x_0)$, since 
        $a-x_0\neq 0,b-x_0\neq 0$
        so $\underset{M\to\infin}{\lim}\int_{\sqrt{M|f''(x_0)|}(a-x_0)}^{\sqrt{M|f''(x_0)|}(b-x_0)}\frac{e^{-\frac{y^2}{2}}}{\sqrt{M|f''(x_0)|}}dy=\underset{M\to\infin}{\lim}\int_{-\infin}^{\infin}\frac{e^{-\frac{y^2}{2}}}{\sqrt{M|f''(x_0)|}}dy=\underset{M\to\infin}{\lim}\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{M|f''(x_0)|}}$
        - the rest is trivial.
      - the bound proof
        is based on 
        1. the limit boundness and continuity, so ${\displaystyle f''(c)\geq f''(x_{0})-\varepsilon .}$ 
          or 
          - ${\displaystyle f''(x_{0})+\varepsilon <0.}$ which then ensures $f(x)\le f(x_0)$ based on $f'(x_0)=0$
            then ${\displaystyle |x-x_{0}|\geq \delta ,f''(x_{0})<0}\Rightarrow{\displaystyle f(x)\leq f(x_{0})-\eta }$
        2. similar to the above inspiration,
          substitute ${\displaystyle y={\sqrt {n(-f''(x_{0})+\varepsilon )}}(x-x_{0}).}$
        3. the rest is trivial for $a,b\neq\infin$
           1. $\underset{n\to\infin}{\lim}e^{-\eta n}\to 0$ is the dominant item in the limit.
        4. if 
          - > Note that the above proof obviously fails
            - because $b-a=\infin$ which is independent from $n$, so $\underset{n\to\infin}{\lim}(b-a)e^{-\eta n}$ is undetermined.
          - sufficient but *not necessary* assumption ${\displaystyle \int _{a}^{b}e^{nf(x)}\,dx<\infty ,n=1}$
            see above "in [this]"
            - $e^{R+Mf(x_0)}$ is factor, it can be ignored when compared with $\infin$
              then the rest is just $\sqrt{\frac{2\pi}{|f''(x_0)|}}$
            - > but it is enough to demand that the integral is finite for some ${\displaystyle n=N.}$
              
              i.e. use $e^{-(n-N)\eta}\int_{a}^{b}e^{Nf(x)}dx$ where $0*A=0,A=\int_{a}^{b}e^{Nf(x)}\neq\infin$
          - TODO 
            - "the maximum of the function at $x_{0}$ must be a "true" maximum 
            (the number ${\displaystyle \eta >0}$ must exist)"
- see [miscs_ipynb] for related infos about quadrature.
- compared with p173, 
  partial function $\exists a\in A\exists b_1,b_2\in B,f(a)=b_1\wedge (f(a)=b_2\Rightarrow b_1=b_2)$
  total function $\forall a\in A\exists b_1,b_2\in B,f(a)=b_1\wedge (f(a)=b_2\Rightarrow b_1=b_2)$ this is a bit contrary to the definition of the onto function, while the latter doesn't need uniqueness.

- [Calculus of variations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations#Euler%E2%80%93Lagrange_equation)
  here "variations" are "small changes in functions and functionals". More intuitively, it means $\delta y(x)$ which means the difference for the **entire** function instead of at one specific point, see [profoundphysics](https://profoundphysics.com/calculus-of-variations-for-beginners/).
  - > Generally, a valid functional that takes in a full function and returns just a *single* number can be obtained by writing the functional as a *definite integral*.
    > crucially, the *same* number for all values of the variable *x*

    so it describes the property of the *entire* function, see [functional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_(mathematics)#Duality) typically as one [definite integral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations#Example).
    - See the table in "Functions vs Functionals".
    - > a functional derivative considers the change in a functional *with respect to a function*
    - > **Similarly**, there is an important concept in calculus of variations called the variation of a functional.
    - "What Does The Euler-Lagrange Equation Tell Us?" where $\frac{\delta F}{\delta y}$ can be used to optimize for the maxima and minima.
      > The goal of these steps and of any calculus of variations problem is to *find the function y(x)* – the function making a given *functional stationary*.
    - steps:
      1. Write down a functional F(y) describing the problem in the form of a *definite integral* over some function f(x,y,y’).
      2. *Identify* the integrand function f(x,y,y’). You’ll need this for the Euler-Lagrange equation.
      3. Write down the Euler-Lagrange equation for the function f identified in the last step.
      4. Solve the resulting *differential equation* for y(x). This is the function that makes the original functional F(y) stationary.

  2. real numbers
    - example 5
      is based on [**contradiction**][Cantor_diagonal_argument_string] between assumption that the set *can be listed* which is by sequence property and the result that one element is *not in the list*.
      - $\frac{m}{2^n}$ for $m$ is odd due to something like $\frac{3}{4}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{2}$, so the latter two have two binary expansions implies the 1st also has.
        - This is the book why
          > expansion has a tail end that consists entirely of the digit 9 is excluded
          - IMHO this exclusion **doesn't influence** the book proof because their decimal representation is not same although their eventual values are *same*.
            This is similar to the above where allows something like $0.1000\ldots$ and $0.0111\ldots=0.1000\ldots$ to both exist.
            but not the [following](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor's_diagonal_argument#Real_numbers)
            - But for the following wikipedia proof, it **influences** because it needs to construct one **bijection** map which doesn't allow *two* different decimal/binary representations mapped to the *same* real value.
      - ~~TODO meaning of~~
        > Also, f2 (t) is not a bijection to (0, 1) for the strings in T appearing after the binary point in the binary expansions of 0, 1, and the numbers in sequence r.

        TODO means same as
        >  These are called dyadic numbers and have the form m / 2n where m is an odd integer and n is a natural number
      - > Define the bijection g(t) from T to (0, 1): If t is the nth string in sequence s, let g(t) be the nth number in sequence r ; otherwise, g(t) = 0.t2.

        this just *scales* the subset $r$ with "two binary expansions" to *half*, but due to infinite, the scale doesn't take the effects for the cardinality.
        more specifically, it ensures *one-to-one index* for $s\to r,\text{ where }s\in T$.
        - then the rest $T-s$, it is trivial that they are one-to-one. <a id="binary_string_0_1"></a>
        - here one-to-one is trivial
          - [due](https://abstractmath.org/MM/MMRealNumbers.htm#:~:text=Every%20real%20number%20can%20be,for%20numbers%20such%20as%202.56.)) to
            > A real number is a number that can be represented as a (possibly infinite) decimal expansion

            even without the above map, the decimal expansion is onto to $R$, so also $(0,1)$.
      - Then use "composite function" to enlarge the bijection.
      - > He first removed a countably infinite subset from each of these sets so that there is a *bijection* between the remaining *uncountable* sets

        here assume that uncountable infinite can biject to each other.
- Here we compare [Cantor_diagonal_argument_string] with ["rational numbers are countable"](https://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/rational-numbers-countable.php) <a id="rational_countable_real_uncountable"></a>
  if use the latter for the former, then it will be stuck at the string set $s_1$ if it is the digit which starts with one single zero, so it *can't* prove $\mathbb{R}$ is countable.
  
  If use the former for the latter, due to finite or [infinite **repeat** (the key is $\mod 7$ has finite results, so repeat)](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1131628/1059606), we can't use the construction method because it *may generate one irrational*. (If taking something like $\overline{01}$ in account, then all can be seen as finite, the construction method can work but it can only generate finite 
  $s_i$ then, so countable) (This seems to be said somewhere in this note).

  [see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis#Cardinality_of_infinite_sets)

- [universe of discourse](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Discrete_Mathematics/Logic/Page_2#Universe_of_Discourse) ,i.e. domain
- For the exercises here, I only reviewed them by thinking of how to prove them and don't write down the proofs to most of them because they are similar to the book exercises after each subsection which are enough to grasp the ideas.
- 1.1.3 exercise 1
  $$
  \forall x\in X \cup(Y \cap Z)\\
  \Rightarrow x\in X\vee (x\in Y\wedge x\in Z)\\
  \Rightarrow
  \begin{cases}
    \xRightarrow{\text{if }x\in X\text{ but }x\notin Y \cap Z} x\in X\cup Y\\
    \xRightarrow{\text{if }x\in Y\cap Z\text{ then }x\in X\cup Y\text{ due to }x\in Y} x\in(X\cup Y)\cap Z 
  \end{cases}\\
  \text{ the above case 1 may deny this conclusion and the \textbf{exercise 2 solves} this problem}
  $$
- 1.1.4 $\bigcup$ and $\overline{Z}\text{ with }Z$ may imply "proof by cases".
- section 2.2 EXAMPLE 11 uses **logic**, i.e. definition, to prove set equation.
- always "as desired" to mark as $\blacksquare$ which may end with $\blacksquare$ again ~~or not~~.
- ~~"specialization" means similar to "instantiation" in section 1.6 TABLE 2 p103 -> "in particular".~~
- contraposition is based on ~~"converse"~~ contrapositive.
- $(p \wedge \neg q) \to r$
  is based on
  $$
  \text{suppose }p\text{ is true. the following skip some trivial steps}\\
  \begin{cases}
    q=T
    \begin{cases}
      \xRightarrow{\text{left side, i.e. }(p \wedge \neg q) \to r} r=F/T\\
      \xRightarrow{\text{right side, i.e. }p \to (q\vee r)} r=F/T
    \end{cases}\\
    q=F
    \begin{cases}
      \xRightarrow{\text{left side}} p\to r\\
      \xRightarrow{\text{right side}} p\to r\\
    \end{cases}
  \end{cases}
  $$
  - or more intuitively
    the left side means if both p and **not q**, then r
    the right side means if p, then either q or **not q** which implies r simialr to p6. <a id="tautology_q_neg_q"></a>
    trivially they mean same.
- > have no way of using the hypothesis

  this is based on using the direct proof, i.e. $f(x_1)=f(x_2)$ and $x_1<x_2$ don't match.
  but if using WLOG and "proof by contradiction", $\neg(f(x_1)<f(x_2))=(f(x_1)=f(x_2))\Rightarrow\neg (x_1<x_2)=(x_1=x_2)$ which is just the "However ..." context.
- p9
  $(p\wedge\neg r\to\neg q)\equiv( q\to\neg p\vee r)$
  similar to [this](#tautology_q_neg_q), $q$ with $p$ correspond to $r$ after the $\vee$.
  - or think it as p is **the ~~assumption~~ hypothesis** as the doc says,
    then $\neg r\to \neg q$ contraposition is $q\to r$
- 1.2.1 exercises
  1. it is to prove $\forall x\notin B\to x\notin A$, this contraposition is just the hypothesis 
    $\forall x\in A\to x\in B\Rightarrow A\subseteq B$
  2. trivial by $M=0\to\ldots$
  3. $y=(x+y)-x$ is trivial
    it is to prove based on assumption $\forall x\in\mathbb{Z}$
    then $\forall y\notin\mathbb{Z}\Rightarrow x+y\notin \mathbb{Z}$, this contraposition is same as before.
  4. similar to 3 
    transform to $x\in A(x\in B\to x\in A\cap B)$
- Example 5 in Section 1.7 shows vacuously true proposition is featured of the negative premise, so $\varnothing \subseteq A \cap \overline{B}$ should be **trivially** true where the conclusion is true regardless of the premise.
- Proof by contradiction
  see p113,114 where
  $\neg q\to(r\wedge\neg r),q\text{ is the conclusion to prove}$ can be thought as $(p \wedge\neg q) \to F,\text{where }p\text{ is }r$ which is shown in "This leads to the contradiction $p\wedge\neg p$" and same as example 14 shows.
- 1.2.2 exercises
  1. trivial using the definition.
    or similarly as the example $\exists x\in A\wedge x\notin A$ contradiction.
  2. since "for all sets A and B"
    suppose select $B\ni A\subseteq B$
    then $B\cap \overline{A}=B$
    if $A\neq \varnothing$
    then 
    $$
    \exists a\in A\subseteq B\Rightarrow a\in B\\
    \text{ but }a\notin \overline{A}\Rightarrow a\notin B\cap \overline{A}\text{ contradiction }\tag*{$\blacksquare$}
    $$
  3. suppose $\neq\varnothing$
    then suppose $T=x\in A\cup B$
    let $S=(\overline{A} \cup \overline{B})\cap(\overline{A} \cup B)\cap(A \cup \overline{B})$
    then
    - if $x\in (A\cap \overline{B})$, then 
      $x\notin (\overline{A} \cup B)\Rightarrow x\notin S\Rightarrow x\notin S\cap T$
    - for $x\in (A\cap B)$ and 
      $x\in (B\cap \overline{A})$, it is similar.
- 1.2.3
  1. example 16
    $$
    \text{since }A\neq\varnothing\wedge B\neq\varnothing\\
    \Rightarrow\forall (a,b)\in A\times B\text{, i.e. } a\in A,b\in B\\
    \Rightarrow (a,b)\in B\times A\\
    \Rightarrow A\subseteq B,B\subseteq A\\
    \Rightarrow A=B
    $$
  2. the 2nd is similar to the above
  3. first assume $A\neq\varnothing$, then to prove $B=\varnothing$
    - then use contradiction
      if $B\neq\varnothing$
      then $A\times B\neq\varnothing$ which contradicts with the hypothesis $A\times B=\varnothing$
  4. 
    $$
    \forall x\in (X\cup Y)\cap Z\wedge x\notin X\\
    \xRightarrow{(X\cup Y)\cap\overline{X}} x\in Y\\
    \xRightarrow{\cap Z} x\in (Y\cap Z)\\

- ALGORITHM 7 better adds:
```python
  while 
    ...
  if n==0:
    break
```
- the lemma 1 just means always using the optimized choice.
- p369 to prove the example 7
  - $P(n)$ just means the greedy is the **optimal** when it selects $n$ talks
  - basis: uses the overlap implied by the greedy.
    "end after $e_1$" because $e_1$ is the 1st ending.
  - inductive: 
    1. prove the $e_1$ ~~will~~ can be always chosen **regardless** of whether to use the greedy algorithm. (prove the 1st step is optimal)
    2. assume $e_1$ has been chosen, then based on the compatible index set 
      $S=\{x|s_x>e_1\}$ which is also **regardless** of whether to use the greedy algorithm
      then $P(k)$ which is optimal to 
      $S$ based on the induction hypothesis, this constructs the $P(k+1)$ with $e_1$ $\blacksquare$.
      (prove the next k are also optimal which is just based reusing $P(1)$ k times after removing the uncompatible talks)
      - Also obviously $e_1$ is **always chosen** by the greedy algorithm because it is the *1st* ending.

    so finding one special counterexample is enough.
    - for example, in the above link, $g()$ 
      (i.e. $K(P)$ in the book) has no valid inputs to output, i.e. not one computable function.
    - the link $halts(P)=H(P,P)\text{ in the book}$
    - The wikipedia proof needs much prerequisite knowledge "relies on the following constructs", "Turing-complete", etc. 
      TODO this is out of my current ability.
- the bubble sort just uses the pair chains to select the **maximum** in the list in each pass, so $i$ plus one and $j$ minus one in each pass in ALGORITHM 4.
- the [insertion sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort#Best,_worst,_and_average_cases) just tracks one more item which creates one ordered sublist beginning from the first item.
  the 2nd ~~is similar to the 1st except that it moves `x` directly to the correct place instead of propagating (the swap counts are same).~~ avoids many unnecessary swaps which uses 3 assignments by using all one assignment each time with one additional $x \leftarrow A[i]$ which is same as ALGORITHM 5 does.
  the 3rd is the recursive version of the 2nd.
- ~~TODO~~
  since "ALGORITHM 3" $j\coloneqq m$ doesn't exclude one element.
  > The search has now been restricted to a list with no more than $\lceil n/2\rceil$ elements
  if n is odd, then after comparison, either $\frac{n+1}{2}=\lceil n/2\rceil$ or $\frac{n-1}{2}$ is left
  if n is even, ~~either~~ $\frac{n}{2}$ ~~or $\frac{n}{2}-1$~~ is left.
  - based on the above,
    p256 when n is odd, it may be always leave more than half elements, i.e. $\frac{n+1}{2}$
    so it may use $\lceil \log{n}\rceil$ comparisons.

- [weak induction](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs2800/2015fa/lectures/lec18-euclid.html) which can be transformed to strong induction trivially.
  from 5.2 introduction, mathematical induction in the book is same as above.
### 5.1
- inductive reasoning [diff](https://www.scribbr.com/methodology/inductive-deductive-reasoning/#:~:text=What's%20the%20difference%20between%20inductive,general%20premises%20to%20specific%20conclusions.) deductive reasoning

  - So only 3~5 are the key steps.
- EXAMPLE 13
  case i: Here we assume each person has one pie.
- > this step requires that $k\ge 3$
  because
  ~~> the first k ... $p_1$~~
  ~~> the last k of these lines meet in a common point $p_2$~~
  ~~if k=2, then ~~
  > $p_1$ and $p_2$ were different points, all lines containing both of them must be the same line because two points determine a line
  if k=2, then $p_1$ and $p_2$ may be shared by *only one* line, so it is ok for "them must be the same line".

  See [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/499789/proof-of-division-algorithm-using-well-ordering-principle#comment10474315_499789) -> QA which means same.
### 5.3
- [Well-formed formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-formed_formula) is related with compiler.
- structural induction is just one special "mathematical induction"
  without using definition to prove like EXAMPLE 10.
  - > if the statement is true for each of the elements used to *construct* new elements in the recursive step of the definition
    the main idea is to find the way to construct.
### 5.4

  so here two cases of "either or" can be achieved at the same time, i.e. we can draw *both* one red and one blue triangles among six vertices.

- EXAMPLE 7 b
  here
  > We do not use the generalized pigeonhole principle to answer this question, because we want to make sure that there are three hearts, not just three cards of one suit.
  it means the "pigeonhole principle" doesn't care about what hole the pigeon is in, so when specifying hole (i.e. "hearts" here), we can't use the principle.
- > either $a_s < a_t$ or $a_s > a_t$
  implies "either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing".
- After all, the Pigeonhole Principle is based on chapter 1 contradiction proof, i.e. assuming not $at least$, then at most -> leading number contradiction.

- "poker hand" is just one basic counting unit.
### 6.5

- example 6
  select $m$ elements -> reorder them in the nondecreasing order which corresponds to **one unique sequence**.
  since the reorder is done after selection, so selection is unordered.
- > Then cards dealt to the *first player* *correspond to* the cards in the *positions* assigned to objects of the *first type* in the permutation

  here "correspond" implies one-to-one from distribution of hands of 5 cards to permutations ~~positions~~ (i.e. the 2nd player, etc, can't be mapped to 1st). It also implies onto because the correspondance always holds so we can always find what to be mapped to the ith type. More intuitively, $\text{let }(i,a_i)\text{ means } i\text{th card goes to }a_i\text{th player},\text{while it can be \textbf{also} interpreted as }i\text{th location goes to }a_i\text{th type}$. See exercise 50 map.
  - The above means
    $a,b,c,d,e$ cards where the order doesn't matter correspond to the $a,b,c,d,e$ location where the order also doesn't matter. Here although indistinguishable items are *same*, their **locations are not**.
    - More specifically
      card -> location
      player -> type (one player has many cards -> one type has many locations)
    - Also [see](#comparison_6_5_theorem_3_with_4) and exercise 49,50 ans where 50 is similar to the above with the map corresponding to the above $\text{card/location}\to \text{player/type}$.
  - It is also shown in the relation between example 7 and theorem 3 where both use the same form of products among $C(n_i,k_i)$
- theorem 3 can be also seen as

  then divide by duplicate situations, then $/\Pi n_i!$

        - obviously here to split the rest 0 element into $k=1$ classes (i.e. 0 elements) ~~if not choosing the only one element~~, it is impossible, so $\genfrac\{\}{0pt}{}{0}{1}=0$ which can be generalized to $\genfrac\{\}{0pt}{}{0}{k},k>0$

          - here [$\Pi$](https://proofwiki.org/wiki/Definition:Continued_Product/Vacuous_Product) implies Vacuous Product should be 1.
      - Similarly, ${n+1 \brace 1}=1*{n \brace 1}+{n \brace 0}$

- lexicographic (or dictionary) ordering is one type of canonical cycle notation.
- > It is left for the reader to show that this produces the next larger r-combination in lexicographic order.
  here "lexicographic order" implies that $a_i\le n-r+i$,
  so "locate the last element ai in the sequence such that $a_i \neq n − r + i$." will ensure all later elements $a_k,k\ge i$ are their corresponding **largest in their possible** choices. So we can only add $a_i$ if increasing from right to left similar to the **carry** in the normal addition process. Then the carry and the **increasing order** needs $j-i$ in $a_j=a_i+1+j-i$.
  - Also see exercise 11 which is same as the above.
- > (The verification of this fact is left as an exercise for the reader.)
  - Also see exercise 10
  - Similar to comparison between normal numbers, we begin from right to left.
    $a_{j+1}>a_{j+2}>\dots>a_n$ means they are **largest** using $a_{k},k=(j+1)\sim n$ since each digit from left to right is the largest possible one, so we can't rearrange them to get the next larger. This corresponds to exercise 10 ans
    > the old permutation was the **last** one with $a_1 , a_2 , \lodts , a_{j−1} , a_j$ in those positions

    $a_j<a_{j+1}$ means it can be enlarged.
    - Then use the above process again with $a_j$
      - ALGORITHM 1
        here after "interchange $a_j$ and $a_k$", $a_j'=a_k,a_{k-1}>a_k>a_j=a_k'>a_{k+1}$, so the decreasing order of 
        $a_{j+1}>a_{j+2}>\dots>a_{n-1}>a_n$ still holds.
      - ~~so $a_j$ with $a_{k+1},\dots,a_n$ can't be enlarged due to $a_j>$~~
        Since we need to find the next one adjacent number larger than original, it must be bigger than the original at $j$th digit, so we find the **smallest** $a_k>a_j$. Then to get the **smallest** next larger, we list increasingly from left to right for the rest digits. This corresponds to exercise 10 ans
        > Furthermore the new permutation is the **first** one (in lexicographic order) with $a_1 , a_2 , \lodts , a_{j−1} , a_k$ in positions 1 to j
        > Since $a_k$ was picked to be the **smallest number greater** than $a_j$ among $a_{j+1} , a_{j+2} , \ldots , a_n$, there can be no permutation between these two.

      This has one implicit possibility $p_1<1$ which needs to be multiplied.
      - so $p(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\binom{n}{k}} E_i) < 1$ should be $p(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\binom{n}{k}} E_i)*p_1 < 1$
      - Also $p(E_i) = 2*(1/2)^{k(k−1)/2}$ overcounts.

### 9.3
- in FIGURE 2, the diagonal can be 0 or 1.
- EXAMPLE 5 says the usage of the Boolean product.
### 9.4
- For transitive closure, we only need to think about $(a,b),a\neq b$ because $(a,a)$ will always *do nothing* when composite. <a id="transitive_reflexive"></a>
  - This is also shown in 9.6-exercise-2 ans
    > the nonreflexive pairs will not introduce any violations of antisymmetry.
    and 9.6-exercise-8 ans
    > The only pairs that might present problems with transitivity are the nondiagonal pairs
- Here $R\cup \triangle$ *only adds necessary* pairs for reflexive closure.
  similarly, $R\cup R^{-1}$ also *only adds necessary* ones.
  So *minimal* and with *the related property*
  Then "contain" is ensured by $\cup$
  So the following 3 conditions are met.
  > Because this relation *contains R, is reflexive, and is contained within every* reflexive relation that contains R, it is called the reflexive closure of R
- > The only ordered pairs not in $R^{\ast}$ are those containing states that are not connected to the continental United States
  TODO here 
  > contains (a, b) if state a and state b have a common border.
  doesn't exclude $(a,b)$ where $a,b$ not have $n$ borders distant based on $R^n$.
  so it can contain " states that are not connected to the continental United States".
- > If (a, b) ∈ R∗ and (b, c) ∈ R∗, then there are paths from a to b and from b to c in R. We obtain a path from a to c by starting with the path from a to b and following it with the path from b to c. Hence, (a, c) ∈ R∗
  More specifically, $(a,b)\in R^{m}$ and $(b,c)\in R^{n}$
  so $(a,c)\in R^{m+n}\in R^{\ast}$ as [this](#power_relation_associativity) shows.
- > Because S is transitive, $S^n$ also is transitive
  [It](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1701431/1059606) uses $R^n\subseteq R$
  - $R\subseteq S\Rightarrow R^k\subseteq S^k$ is trivial based on the definition of $\subseteq$.
    or more specially, $R^k=(f(S))^k$ where $f(S)$ only removes something from $S$
    Then $S^k=R^k+(\overline{R})^k+M$ where $M$ takes both $R,\overline{R}$ 
    for the composite operation after excluding $R^k\cup (\overline{R})^k$
    and $\overline{R}=S-R$
- > Suppose that a = b and that m > n, so that m ≥ n + 1 ... among the m vertices x0, x1, … , xm−1
  change this to $m > n-1$ 
  we can get the case $a\neq b$
  because here when $m=n$, there are $m+1=n+1$ vertex including $a,b$, then "the pigeonhole principle".

  here we only needs to check distance-1 case because the case
  > has only v1 = a, v2 = b
  has been contained in the before cases, e.g. after the before conditions, one path $(k_1,k_2)$ from 
  $(k_1,v_1),(v_1,k_2)$ is generated.
  Then for the path $k_1'-v_1-v_2-k_2'$ or $k_1'-v_1-Seq(k_i)-v_2-k_2'$
  it *only needs to add* $v_1-v_2-k_2'$ and 
  $Seq(k_i)_{end}-v_2-k_2'$ because the rest is *already generated*.
  - This is shown in Figure 4 after I thought of the above.
- EXAMPLE 8 Also see the [Warshall_code]
  - $W_n$ for $n\time n$ matrix doesn't always generate all-row-equal matrix.
    For example, diagonal matrix. 
- Here in Lemma 2, "if and only if" is by definition of $W_k$.
- Compare Algorithm 1 with Algorithm 2
  the former has $i:= 2 to n$ which function similar to $k := 1 to n$
  While the former does $2n-1$ ($n$ multiplication and $n-1$ addition) for each entry of $n^2$ entries of the matrix and the latter only has $2$. This is the key difference.
### 9.5
- If thinking of "equivalence relation" as "class"
  then it will imply "reflexive, symmetric, and transitive".
  Why "reflexive, symmetric, and transitive" $\to$ "equivalence"
  is related with [abstract-algebra](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3299949/1059606) or is based on function <a name="equivalence_relation_definition"></a>
  > A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is an equivalence relation if and only if there is a function
- EXAMPLE 3 shares $a-b$ with EXAMPLE 2, so their proofs are similar.
- > The proof that $[b] \subseteq [a]$ is similar; it is left as an exercise for the reader.
  just swap $a$ and $b$.
- > it follows that these equivalence classes are either equal or disjoint,

- > an index set is a set whose members label, or index, the elements of a set.
  It just have another set which only needs one bigger cardinality (["surjective"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_set#)) as [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_set#Examples)
  > Any countably infinite set can be (injectively) indexed by the set of natural numbers $\mathbb {N}$.
- > We have seen that the equivalence classes of an equivalence relation on a set form a parti-tion of the set
  because $a\not R b\Rightarrow ([a]_{R},[b]_{R}\neq \varnothing) \wedge ([a]_{R}\cap [b]_{R}=\varnothing) \wedge (\bigcup_{a\in A}[a]_R=A)$.
  It also shows
  > by the definition of R, these are the subsets of S in the partition
  - Then
    > To see this, assume that {Ai ∣ i ∈ I} is a partition on S. Let R be the relation on S consisting of the pairs (x, y)
    is to show "Partition" $\to$ "equivalence relation".
    The books shows "subset" $\to$ "equivalence relation"
### 9.6
- > When we add all of the pairs of the form (x, x) to these relations, we obtain a relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive
  i.e. if not $=$ just 
  $<$, it is asymmetric and the rest is same.
- > We do *not need a basis step* in a proof using the principle of well-ordered induction because if x0 is the least element of a well-ordered set, the inductive step tells us that P(x0) is true.
  i.e. the inductive step *includes* the basis step.
  > This follows because there are no elements $x \in S$ with $x \prec x_0$, so we know (using a vacuousproof) that P(x) is true for all $x \in S$ with $x \prec x_0$
  THEOREM 1 says $\forall x \prec y,P(x)=True\Rightarrow P(y)=True$
  since $\not\exist x\prec y$, the predicate is False, and $F\to T$ is [tautology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology_(logic)#:~:text=In%20mathematical%20logic%2C%20a%20tautology,y%20or%20x%E2%89%A0y%22.), so $P(y)=True$
- > The verification of this is left as an exercise.
  Here I assume lexicographic order is same as [wikipedia definition][Lexicographical_order] ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_order#Cartesian_products)) (~~What "Added" wants to say: [preorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preorder) can be either symmetric or antisymmetric~~) <a name="lexicographic_order_partial_order_proof"></a>
  Here antisymmetric is trivial.

- example 18: we can find the bound by **traverse along the lines** beginning from *all* elements of the set.
  - $\{a,b,c\}$: 
    - upper bound: obviously we only needs to care about $\{b,c\}$
      then we find $e$ and transitively $\{f,j,h\}$
      For $\{d,g\}$ we can't include 
      $c$.
    - lower bound is trivial.
  - $\{h,j\}$
    - lower bound: similarly $f$ and transitively ...
    - upper bound: trivial
  - $\{a,c,d,f\}$ , i.e. $\{f\}$
- >  every pair of elements has both a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound,
  ~~it must contain *all* elements of the set~~
  ~~TODO So it is to say all elements *share* a least upper bound and a greatest lower bound~~
- Based on [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2067965/1059606), it needs to find the exact least upper bound and greatest lower bound, so there may be no simple solution for EXAMPLE 21.
  The counterexample in FIGURE 8 (b) is that it has 4 pairs for $b\sim e$ but $d,e$ are incomparable.
- > The least upper bound and greatest lower bound of these two integers are the least common multiple and the greatest common divisor of these integers, respectively, as the reader should verify
  to find The least upper bound, we first find the upper bound for $(a,b)$
  then obvious they are $\{k\vert k=i\cdot lcm(a,b),i\in \mathbb{N^+}\}$
  then take the least.
  similarly the lower bounds are $\{k\vert k\vert gcd(a,b),k\in \mathbb{N^+}\}$
  - Similarly EXAMPLE 24 is done by $\cap,\cup$ definition.
- > A total ordering $\preccurlyeq$ is said to be compatible with the partial ordering R
  it can be seen as that $\preccurlyeq$ can be constructed from $R$
  Notice here $R\subset \preccurlyeq$ (See example 26 where the original one contain 3 chains $(1,2,4,12),(1,2,4,20),(1,5,20)$)

      - if choosing $af$, still reduced to $G_3$ somewhat
  - > Finally, the reader should verify that $\lambda(G_5) = 3$, because the removal of any two of its edges does not disconnect
    - similarly we can choose 2 edges from 2 $K_4$ because that would not even make these $K_4$ disconnected.
    - Then if choosing one edge from 2 $K_4$ and one outside 2 $K_4$, the 2 edges must be incident with one same endpoint. Obviously not possible to disconnect.

          because there must one cycle including them after adding the edge.
          So after *removing the added* edge, we can't return back if starting from the vertex in *other cycles* different from the cycle including the added edge.

          ~~Notice it only means the paths constructed by theorem 1,2 will fail if not starting from odd vertices, but it *doesn't exclude other paths*.~~ See [unique_start_euler_path]

      - ~~TODO why~~ p49 "BA is a bridge"?
        maybe because if ending at $A$, then $A$ will be disconnected with the rest.
      - Then for $G_3$ (Here we only needs to exclude "even-even" edge when 2-odd which will increase 2 odd vertices leading to 4 odd vertices)
        we start from $a$ with 2-odd-$(a,b)$

- ~~TODO~~ prove [conditions for the directed graph](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/euler-circuit-directed-graph/) to have the Euler Circuit. Also [this](https://www.topcoder.com/thrive/articles/eulerian-path-and-circuit-in-graphs) for Euler path.
  - $H_1$ has $a$ with in-degree 0, so no Euler path.
- THEOREM 1
  - NECESSARY CONDITIONS
    it splits edges into 3 cases:
    1. start (add 1 degree)
    2. end (add 1 degree)
    3. pass-through (add 2 degrees)
  - SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS
    Same as [find_euler_circuit_undirected_path]
    based on the assumption that the graph is *connected* (then with even degrees, it means "the degree must be at least two"), we can *splice* the graph by many cycles which always use *even* degrees

    Here many cycles are constructed by the algorithm 1 "while H has edges".
  - Notice here any even number of cycles can't share one edge
    basis step: 2 distinct cycles share edge $vw$
      then $v,w$ has degree 3
    for 3 distinct cycles, then 2 cycles can be combined into one.
    The rest is similar.
- > Hence, it has an Euler path that must have b and d as its endpoints
  Obviously the EULER circuit is *unique* which can be started from anywhere. (we can split the vertex with degree greater than 2 into distinct vertices all with degree 2, then the circuit become one *simple cycle*.) <a name="unique_start_euler_path"></a>
  Then after removing one edge, the euler path can be *only* started from the endpoint of the removed edge.
- > Euler circuits and paths are applied is in the layout of circuits
  TODO how apply?

- Although Hamiltonian cycle/path has [necessary conditions](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3449552/1059606) (obviously have because it just means the properties of the Hamiltonian cycle/path), it is difficult to *find* due to [NP-complete](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4431330/what-is-the-necessary-and-sufficient-condition-for-a-graph-to-be-a-hamiltonian-c#comment9276260_4431330) one.
  - TODO undirected [to directed](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/81565/1059606).
- EXAMPLE 5
  - $G_2$ can use $b,c,d$ as one Hamilton sub-circuit which obviously *can't be less*, but to include $a$, $ab$ needs to included twice.
  - Here $G_3$
    - Hamilton path
      - we can use [this method][check_Hamilton_path] same as [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/1958887/1059606) 1,2 by *removing edges* which is similar to the main ideas of the euler path
      - since here we have 3 degree-1 vertex, we can't have one path connecting them, so no Hamilton path.
    - Hamilton circuit
      - We can also use the [cut-vertex][cut_vertex_Hamilton_circuit] to prove no Hamilton circuit exists
        because the cut-vertex $y$ will be passed "at least twice"
        Assume one Hamilton circuit exists and 2 connected components after the split are $V_{1,2}$, then we can start from *arbitrary* vertex 
        $v\in V_1$ due to the *circuit* property, then from $v$ to $w\in V_2$, we need to pass $y$ one time, then back from $w$ to $v$, we still need to pass $y$ one time (Here the must pass of $y$ is due to the cut vertex)
      - The above is same as the [ans](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1959036/1059606) which I read after the comment
        kw: at least twice, *any* vertex as the starting and ending vertex
      - We can use [other properties](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1958887/proving-a-graph-has-no-hamiltonian-cycle#comment10320937_1958887) which is same as what the book says.in p735.

### 10.6
- > has no interior vertices other than a
  based on p657, $a$ is not one interior vertex.
- ALGORITHM 1
  the key is "updates the labels of vertices" which are the minimal distance ~~using~~ staring from vertices in $S$.
  Then "u := a vertex not in S with L(u) minimal" based on the *greedy* algorithm.
  - here basis step (i) is vacuously true because nothing is in $S$.
  - Here "At the kth iteration" should be *before* the $k$th iteration.
    This is implied by
    > From the inductive hypothesis we see that the vertices *in* S *before* the (k + 1)st iteration are labeled with the length of a shortest path from a.
  - > so the length of a shortest path from a to a vertex other than a is $\infty$
    This is because
    > contains only (besides the vertex itself) vertices in S
    and
    > before any iterations are carried out
    so the label has not been updated, so all $\infty$
  - > because Lk (v) is the length of a shortest path from a to v containing only vertices in S *after* the kth iteration
    Then $L_k(v)$ corresponds to 
    $|S|=k$
    and $L_k(v)$ corresponds to 
    $v\not\in S$ and the path $a=s_1,\ldots,s_m,v,m\le k$
  - > There is a path with length less than Lk (v) from a to u containing only vertices of S. This contradicts the choice of v
    i.e. there is one path $a=s_1,\ldots,s_m,u,u_1,\ldots,u_i,v,m\le k$ which has less length where $u_1\sim u_i$ may not exist.
    Then $a=s_1,\ldots,s_m,u$ has less length,
    we should choose $u$ instead of $v$.
    - The contradiction is based on
      > u := a vertex not in S with L(u) minimal
    - > v must be labeled with the length of a shortest path to it from a
      The above proves this key idea where "shortest path" is based on *all possible paths*.
  - > A shortest path from a to u containing only elements of S
    based on the algorithm construction
    here it doesn't mean containing *all* of $S$.
  - > then by the inductive hypothesis its length is Lk (u)
    Here $L_k()$ only considers 
    vertices in $S$, so although maybe some path $a=s_1,\ldots,s_m,w,w_1,\ldots,w_i,u$ is shorter than 
    $a=s_1,\ldots,s_m',u$, we don't consider it.
    - This is just what (ii) states.
  - > then it must be made up of a path from a to v of shortest possible length containing elements of S other than v, followed by the edge from v to u.
    because if $v$ is not the last vertex before $u$,
    then the path must be $a=s_1,\ldots,s_m,v,s_{m+1},\ldots,s_{m+k},u$ which is longer than ~~original path $a=s_1,\ldots,s_m,v,u$ when $v$ is the last vertex~~ directly from $S$ to $u$ which at least removes $s_m,v$ and $v,s_{m+1}$.
- here should be "2(n − 1) comparisons" and "n − 1 additions".

### 11.1
- THEOREM 1 proof
  - We can also use the [leaf node](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1334024/1059606)
    or the **sub**-cycle as the book says (Exercise 59 of Section 10.4) or the above link.
- > the reader should show that such a vertex is unique
  otherwise one cycle is constructed.
- Theorem 2 is similar to [QA link referred in this QA](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/4849754/1059606)
  - Notice it is possible for ["all cut edges"][tree_imply_all_cut_edge_i_e_no_circuit]
  - "a leaf of T" -> "the diameter of $G$"
- > Also, when (i) and (iii) hold, then (ii) must also hold, 
  This is due to that to keep the connectivity, the 1st can connect 2 vertices, while the rest can at most connect one more each. So $n-1$.
  > and when (ii) and (iii) hold, (i) must also hold.
- [complete "same"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M-ary_tree#Types_of_m-ary_trees) is stronger than balanced ["n/n-1" p15](https://w3.cs.jmu.edu/spragunr/CS228/lectures/trees/trees.pdf).
- > Rooted trees can also be defined *recursively*. Refer to Section 5.3 to see how this can be done.
  i.e. Definition 3 which is defined by *level*.
  We can do this by branch each node *down* instead of at the same level or up due to *no circuits*. <a name="tree_level_recursive"></a>
- see p785 rooted trees are *default to be ordered*.
### 11.2
- ALGORITHM 1
  - > If x equals the key of v, then the algorithm has found the location of x and terminates
    This implies $v\neq null$ and $label(v) = x$, obviously implying `root of T = null`.
    So it skips `if` and directly terminates.
  - `root of T = null` is the init step
  - for `while` there are 3 possibilities
    1. `v=null`, then no `label(v)` (to insert)
    2. $v\neq null$ and $label(v) \neq x$ (continue the `while` loop)
    3. $v\neq null$ and $label(v) = x$ (find one)
  - `v is null or label(v) \neq x` may be ~~wrong~~ not strictly right.
    because it contains
    1. `v is not null and label(v) \neq x` which is impossible due to the `while` loop
    2. `v is null and label(v) \neq x`
    3. `v is null and label(v) = x` impossible due to invalidity of `label(null)`
- > need only note that by Exercise 74 in Section 3.2 we know that ⌈log n!⌉is Θ(n log n)
  See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/2095472/21294350)
  where $\frac{n}{2}\cdot\log(\frac{n}{2})=\frac{1}{2}\cdot (n\cdot (\log(n)-1))\ge \frac{1}{2}\cdot (n\cdot (\log(n)-\frac{\log(n)}{2})),(\frac{\log(n)}{2}\gt 1)\ge \frac{1}{2}^2\cdot (n\cdot \log(n))$
- > We obtain the following estimate when we let N = n!
  Here $n!$ is the leaf number.
  Obviously sorting decision tree is A full 2-ary tree because each decision must generate 2 childs (Here we can take the situation $a=b$ into either case).
  so based on 11.1 THEOREM 4 (iii), we should use vertex number $2\cdot l-1=2n!-1$
  trivially, $g(n)=\Omega (\log(2n!-1))\Rightarrow g(n)\ge k\log(2n!-1),n>n_0\Rightarrow g(n)\ge k\log(2n!-n!=n!),n>n_0\Rightarrow g(n)=\Omega (\log(n!))$

      [This](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23041360/21294350) is really similar because minmax will ensure "the payoff to the first player" to be max when it is the first player's turn.

        Here at each step the player always choose *the best for himself*. So optimal which at least maximize the current player's payoff.

  we can *encode* the tree.
  - The above means same as the contents after example 6 which I read after the above "verification".
  - > Because prefix and postfix expressions are unambiguous and because they can be evaluated easily *without scanning back and forth*, they are used extensively in computer science
    Based on FIGURE 11, the main reason is that in "prefix and postfix", the operator *range* is well defined.
    This is similar to the above.
- > The steps used to evaluate this expression by working right to left, and performing operations using the operands on the right,

  "working right to left" because leaves (operands) are on the right and we must leave the top root (i.e. the leftmost) at the end.
- > An inorder traversal of the binary tree representing an expression produces the original expression with the elements and operations in the same order as they originally occurred, ex-cept for unary operations, which instead immediately follow their operands

  but all after the operator.

  - ~~red is first met because left-to-right searching order.~~
    See the comments like "Visit the current node (in the figure: position red)." which shows the correspondence between the book and wikipedia and also proves the relation between 3 orders and the walk (walk along the path in the figure to get why the above properties hold.)
- > Both the preorder traversal and the postorder traversal encode the structure of an ordered rooted tree *when the number of children of each vertex is specified*
  if not specified, we can use [other conditions][Depth_first_traversal_3_colors] to construct -> [this](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/441/161388)
  Notice here we have *no operators* but just operands.
  - > No one sequentialisation according to pre-, in- or post-order describes the underlying tree uniquely.
    in-order alone is shown in the book or we [don't know what to choose for `[x]`](https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/439/161388).

      TODO IMHO it can as the book says.
  - Notice
    > First, I'll assume that all elements are distinct.
    otherwise the algorithm to check for $x_2=y_i$, etc, fails.
  - Here pre-order traversal with post-order traversal is done by mapping (one-to-one correspondence) between each other.
  - Here $O(n^2)$ may assume using the naive searching algorithm.
    while $O(n\lg(n))$ assume for each 
    $x_i$ searching for $y_j=x_i$ takes $O(\lg(n))$ time.
    - Since maybe level $n-1$ for n vertices. So we may have $n$ iterations and each iteration uses some time to search.
      ```python
      def order([x_1,...,x_n],[y_n,...,y_1]):
        if len([x_1,...,x_n])==1:
          return [x_1,...,x_n]
        j=search(x_1,[y_n,...,y_1]) # {get left-subtree and right-subtree}
        L=order([x_2,...,x_{j-1}],[y_{i-1},...,y_2])+order([x_j,...,x_{n}],[y_{n},...,y_i]) # left appended with right
      ```
  - > Post-order plus in-order is of course symmetric.
    i.e. similar to the pre-order one plus in-order.
    Similarly they are based on mapping.

    - > Each vertex that *ends a path* at a stage of the algorithm will be a *leaf* in the rooted tree, and each vertex where a path is constructed starting at this vertex will be an internal vertex

      It *abandons* this path by dropping the leaf and going backwards.
      > Any *partial* solution that contains two mutually attacking queens can be abandoned.
      - This is same as 11.4.4 says.
      - > Backtracking can be applied only for problems which admit the concept of a "partial candidate solution" and a relatively *quick test of whether it can possibly be completed* to a valid solution.

        "if" is trivial. <a name="DFS_checking_cycle_proof"></a>
        "only if" is due to that ["DFS" with no back edges is one spanning tree](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/11438/why-does-dfs-only-yield-tree-and-back-edges-on-undirected-connected-graphs#comment316453_11552). So its corresponding undirected graph is one tree which implies no cycle.
    - cycle in [directed][Detect_cycle_Directed_Graph]
      - As [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19113189/detecting-cycles-in-a-graph-using-dfs-2-different-approaches-and-whats-the-dif#comment137343260_19115118) said, it just adds `recStack[v] = False` `recStack = [False] * (self.V + 1)`, etc.
      - Here the `visited` is not stack so it will construct one maximal possible tree similar to the spanning tree (i.e. it will reach the most possible vertices *without duplication*)
        - See the [code](./miscs_snippets/py_codes/11_4_61/geeksforgeeks_cycle_directed.py) which shows the code can detect the cycle when there are multiple cycles.
        - > So, we can conclude that a cycle exists. We can also find the cycle if we have traversed to vertex 2 from 0 itself in this same way.
          This is the "smaller" cycle in the following proof.
        - > So if 0 is checked first, we will get the answer that there is a cycle present.
          > On the other hand, if vertex 3 is checked first, then 3 will be marked in visited[] and recStack[].
          based on DFS is based on the stack, "vertex 3 is checked first" won't influence us to construct the circuit because it has *no intersection with the cycle* and then can't construct one cycle variant similar to the above "smaller" cycle (e.g. for $root\to 2\to 3\to root,2\to 4\to 3$, if we have $root\to 2\to 4$ first, then we have one bigger cycle reached before the smaller cycle).
          - Here either the subtree (trivially we assume this subtree has no cycles because if we find one cycle, then based on `return True` in `isCyclicUtil`, we will *end earlier*) of the branch point $v$ has no intersection (then it will be backtracked and we can continue following the cycle because of no intersection) or has. <a name="cycle_branch_out_WITH_proof_after_reaching_cycle"></a>
            For the latter case there are 2 possibilities:
            1. as the above example, intersection $w$ hasn't been visited.
            2. have been:
              Then we find one cycle shares $w\to v$ with the original one.
            - The above is the proof part after reaching the cycle.
        - > It is based on the idea that there is a cycle in a graph only if there is a back edge
          Proof: <a name="directed_graph_detecting_cycle_proof"></a>
          1. Notice this can only find the cycle *including* the root.
            e.g. when we have the in-degree-0 vertex $v$ as the root in $a\to b\to c\to a,a\to v$, we can't even proceed, let alone finding the cycle $a\to b\to c\to a$.
             ~~1. Assume we have one cycle $C:root,a,b,c,\cdots,v,root$~~
               - ~~Then assume $x$ is the first vertex have already been visited and we can't proceed further.~~ (This is one wrong proof)
                 Then trivially we can substitute the path $root\to x$ which may contains many inner vertices by path $p(x)$ 
                 which visits $x$ the first time.
                 Then we find one new cycle $p(x),next(x),\cdots,root$
                 - Use the above process recursively until no vertices in the cycle have been visited before.
                   Since these new paths to substitute the old paths are *inside the tree*, the new cycle is also contained in the tree.
          2. If the root can reach one vertex inside the cycle, then by 1.1, we can also find the cycle.
            If it can reach multiple vertices, we let the *first* vertex be $v$.
            Then when we reach $v$, we must be able to proceed until back to the root which constructs one cycle.
            - Then for the above 1.1 we can prove more elegantly by using "*first*".
              - The above proof is wrong because ~~it doesn't consider the branch point case, i.e.~~ we *may not follow $C$ at all*.
              - Assume we reach $C$ first by $w$ which *may not adjacent to $root$*.
                1. adjacent to $root$ (based on the directio, it has *only one* choice), then we can construct the *whole* $C$
                2. not adjacent. Then $C$ contains one *smaller* cycle which is $root,w,next(w),\cdots,root$.
                - This proof also has defects, because we may branch out inside the cycle as [cycle_branch_out_WITH_proof_after_reaching_cycle] shows which also shows one correct proof.
          3. In summary the cases are
            - root is in the circuit (*)
              - we may reach vertices not in the cycle while constructing the cycle
              - not "reach vertices not in the cycle"
            - not in
              - can reach the circuit then follow the proof of (*)
              - can't reach (only this we ~~may not~~ won't find ~~the~~ this cycle)
          4. The above shows we can follow the circuit where when back to the starting point of this cycle we have one back edge.
  - cross edge can't exist in an undirected graph
    - [1][DFS_no_cross_edge]
      here case 1 just means in the DFS process of $u$ we meet $v$
      case 2 means $u$ has been backtracked, so based on $(u,v)$ it must contain 
      $v$ before when meeting $u$ instead of currently
      - Here case 2 may fail in directed graph because maybe we only have v->u but not u->v and then we can't reach v when rooted at u.

            This is same as [this][u_first_in_the_white_path]
          - [Parenthesis Theorem][lec_13_parenthesis_theorem]
            Here $d(u)<d(v)<f(u)<f(v)$ is impossible because of the process of DFS
            i.e. discover later must means finish (backtrack) earlier 
            - > By parenthesis theorem, w’ is also a descendant of u, contradiction.
              so intersection and one part of $d(u) < d(w’)$ are enough to get the "descendant" relation.
        - Then here just choose arbitrary edge $uv$ to prove it is either a tree edge or a back edge.
          then $uv$ becomes one "white path".

    "a finite number of" vertices may be better because that is our ending target.
  - > add each edge incident to this vertex to the tree as long as it does not produce a simple circuit.
    based on the above $n+1$ similar to DFS, we ensure it is one tree.
    - It is similar to one *star graph*.

    - [BFS](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/shortest-path-unweighted-graph/) to find the shortest is trivial
      It just find len-$1,2,3,\cdots,n$ until find one with the target destination `if (adj[u][i] == dest):`.

        - But `min` in `u <- vertex in Q with min dist[u]` implies its traversal order is not totally same as BFS when in one **weighed** graph.

        this is why $O(|E|)=O(bd)$ as the [top label](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search#) says.

          This implies no adjacency list available. This [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36479640/time-space-complexity-of-depth-first-search#comment69260697_36480122) shows this
        - Also see this [more detailed](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/68371/161388)
    - [IDDFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search#Algorithm_for_directed_graphs)
      - it just call DFS for *each depth* (Iterative deepening) by `DLS(root, depth)`
        1. `remaining` will be false when $any_remaining \leftarrow false$ and `foreach child of node do` has no child. More specifically, i.e. `DLS(leaf,1)` in `DLS(root, h+1)` -> ... -> `DLS(leaf,1)`.
        2. $found, remaining \leftarrow DLS(child, depth−1)$ checks the subtree.
        - So Time complexity [proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search#Time_complexity) $(d+1-k)b^{k}$ where 
          $b^k$ is the vertex number at level $k$
          and $(d+1-k)$ is because each vertex is called with $DLS(v,i),i=0,\ldots,d-k$ which corresponds to $DLS(root,i),i=k,\ldots,d$
          - Also see the reference
        - notice here $b$ is one constant which is *not influenced by the vertex number*.

- > One way to search systematically for a solution is to use a decision tree, where each internal vertex represents a decision and each leaf a possible solution.
  The reason why Backtracking works is due to it is based on the decision tree which is **exhaustive** trivially.
  Then DFS/Backtracking must find one **path** to the solution because DFS will construct the spanning tree which lists **all possibilities/vertices** including the solution.
- FIGURE 12
  - Here is using ["left and right diagonals"](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/printing-solutions-n-queen-problem/) as `# Check upper diagonal on left side` shows which the left elements due to the strictly increasing `col` by `j = j - 1`.
    Or as the book says which I omits carelessly when first reading
    > a diagonal consists of all positions (i, j) with i + j = m for some m, or i − j = m for some m
    - `any placement` implies `or res`
    - `result` saves the list of column indices for each row.
    - `board[i][col] = 0` may be done after the ~~print~~ solution save `result.append(v)` in the leaf node.
  - Here due to symmetry, only 1,2nd row are considered.
- > it can also be used to find the strongly connected components of a directed graph
  It just uses DFS for the [both directions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strongly-connected-components/).
  - `(n + 1)`,`len(adj) + 1` because the index starts from `1` instead of `0`
  - notice here `vis` will be changed in the recursive call
    so when backtracked, it won't access the other direction of the cycle if possible.
    See [scc] with `Use_vis_cp=True`
  - > . It can be used to determine whether a directed graph has a circuit, it can be used to carry out a topological sort of a graph,
    these have been said before.
- > web crawlers have limits to the depth they search in depth-first search.
  i.e. IDDFS
- EXAMPLE 6 can't use BFS because we color one by one instead of [by level][BFS_level_order].
  - Here `a red` must be one [unary node](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15499-s09/www/scribe/lec11/lec11.pdf) followed by `a red, b blue` because we can color one edge arbitrarily.
  - Here we just check the coloring with the **already colored** nodes, which is enough, because the edge is *bidirectional* so if contradiction we can find that when coloring the latter colored one.
- decision-tree related problems can always be solved by backtracking.
### 11.5
- ALGORITHM 1
  - Here after the process, we have 1. no circuits, so "no simple circuits" 2. "n-1 edges".
    "n vertices" is trivial because we haven't added vertices and vertex number keeps $n$.
    Then we prove "connected" by 11.1.3 THEOREM 2.
    ~~To use 11.1.3 THEOREM 2, we need "n vertices", i.e. each added edge adds *one more new vertex* when initially 1 vertex.~~
    ~~- Prove each graph after the iteration is connected.~~ (Ignore the following.)
      - inductive step:
        Since "an edge of minimum weight incident to a vertex in T", then when T is connected, $T+(u,v),u\in V(T)$ is connected because 
        $v$ can be connected with the rest using $u$ as the medium (then all vertex pairs are connected) when $v\notin V(T)$
        when $v\in V(T)$, this is one trivial case.
      - basis step: one edge is trivial.
    ~~- Based on "connected", old vertex will cause the circuit -> contradiction.~~
- > We solve this problem by finding a *minimum spanning tree* in the graph in Figure 1
  the minimum connected graph must be "a minimum spanning tree".
  If not, then it must contain one subgraph which is a spanning tree (See 11.4) with the smaller sum of weights.
- example 1 can't contain the $\$1000$ path.
- Prim’s algorithm proof
  - here $k=0$ is possible.
  - Since $S$ is one tree as the above "ALGORITHM 1" contents shows,
    $S_k,k=1,\cdots,n-1$ must exist.
  - > By starting at an endpoint of ek+1 that is also an endpoint of one of the edges e1, … , ek,
    by the algorithm process, this endpoint must exist.
  - > (it is a tree because it has no simple circuits
    because ~~connected () and~~ $n-1$ edges.
    and based on
    > This simple circuit must contain ek+1
    this (~~although maybe more than one~~) [only one][one_cycle_when_tree_plus_one_edge] circuit is removed, so "no simple circuits".
    Then since vertex number doesn't change, we can use 11.1.3 THEOREM 2.
  - The main idea is to *construct one new* spanning tree from one assumed.
  - [One alternative proof][primsproof]
    - >  so let {a, b} be the first edge on this path with one endpoint (a) inside W
      this must exist because $x,y$ are one in W one not.
    - > Prim’s algorithm will select {a, b} at this step
      i.e. select one edge connecting one vertex in W to one not in.
    - [prefix](https://www.ime.usp.br/~pf/algorithms/chapters/footnotes/math.html)
      in this context it can also not "contain the first term". Then $W=\{x\}$.
    - So the book proof may should use $\{a,b\}$ here and contents before "so let {a, b}" in [primsproof] are same as the book corresponding ones (although the contents after may overlap partly).
      - > we can find an edge e *not in Sk+1* that has an endpoint that is *also an endpoint* of one of the edges e1, e2, … , ek.
        as [primsproof] shows, we can find one counterexample:
        maybe "{a, b}" is in $S_{k+1}$, then continue we may find one edge 
        $e$ has no endpoints in $W$.
        Here "maybe "{a, b}" is in $S_{k+1}$" is due to this edge weight may be the *minimal* at one stage after.
        - In [primsproof], it *only needs "also an endpoint"* instead of 2 conditions as the above shows which is one weaker condition which can be easily met based on "this must exist because $x,y$" above. <a name="Prim_find_incident_edge"></a>
        - ~~**Notice** we can modify the book proof to get the **3rd** proof which is almost same as Kruskal’s in exercise 32.~~
          ~~Here we *only* need "there must be an edge in the simple circuit that does *not belong to* Sk+1" (i.e. "an edge e not in Sk+1")~~
          then $T-\{e\}+\{e_{k+1}\}$ is still one spanning tree with ~~the~~ one ~~maybe *smaller* weight sum (case 1 in [primsproof] and excludes case 3 in [primsproof])~~ (Since Prim's only ensure the smallest weight among edges *incident* with already added vertices, we can't directly say "smaller") and including one more 
          $e_i,i=1\sim n-1$ (case 2 in [primsproof]), contradiction. <a name="MST_scratch"></a>
          - **Notice**
            > Let T be a *minimum spanning tree* of G containing the edges e1, e2, … , ek, where k is the *maximum* integer

            *doesn't need the "incident" requirement*.
            - This also *implies* we can derive Kruskal’s without the stronger conditions in Prim’s, although the [original paper](https://sci-hub.hkvisa.net/10.1090/S0002-9939-1956-0078686-7) doesn't mention it by something like "Prim" or "incident".
    - > Prim’s algorithm hasn’t selected edge {a, b} yet
      because $a\in W, b\notin W$ while selected edge $w=(u,v),\{u,v\}\subseteq W$
- ~~> Kruskal’s algorithm can be carried out using O(m log m) operations and Prim’s algorithm can be carried out using O(m log n) operations.~~
  ~~By CRLS, they are same with "O(m log n)".~~
  > it is preferable to use Kruskal’s algorithm for graphs that are sparse,
  But it is shown in CRLS both in 3rd and 4th exercise 23-2 that we can improve only for Prim’s further.

- [definition 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton#Formal_definition)
  - Here we have no output alphabet and output function but have the final/accepting states in [13_2_definition_1]
- Computable, i.e. [The Halting Problem in 3.1.6](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computable-and-non-computable-problems-in-toc/) and [Decidability](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/decidability-and-undecidability-in-toc/) which is based on reduction.
- example 6
  - a) it trivially enumerates all possible bit strings.
  - b,c,d,e) are related.
- example 7 
  1. trivially enumerates all possible ~~cases~~ states
  2. has 2 input cases for each state.
  So it enumerates all possible cases.
- example 8
  - > We leave it to the reader to fill in the details.
    trivial listing all possible cases.
  - we can also find that $s_0\to s_2\to s_4,s_0\to s_1$ in $M_0$ can be combined into 
    $s_0\to s_1$ in $M_1$.
- > the reader should provide an inductive proof of this
  maybe based on the definition of "recognize" in THEOREM 1.
- notice in EXAMPLE 12, $\{s_0,s_2\}$ only 
  $s_0$ is the final state in Example 10.
  Although letting $\{s_0,s_2\}$ be the final state in EXAMPLE 12 may be ambiguous because it includes oen unnecessary 
  $s_2$, letting $\{s_0,s_2\}$ not be the final state will be *wrong*. 
  So we let $\{s_0,s_2\}$ be the final state.
### 13.4
- EXAMPLE 1
  "any string not ending with 0" can be manipulated from the end back
  where each 1 and the following subsequent continuous are seen as one group (i.e. $0^*1$)
  - similarly, EXAMPLE 2 b) 
    from the ending 0, we either meet the next 0 (i.e. $0^*0$)
    or 1 (i.e. $10$) from where we either meet 0 (i.e. $0^*10$) (from here we can recursively use the process just used) but not 1.
    - c)
      > split into blocks each starting with a 0 and containing one more 0
      starting with 1 is contained in the ending $1^*$ of 
      $1^* 0 1^*$
      - in summary this is based on the process of finding consecutive 0 which may meet 1 between each pair of 0's/
- THEOREM 1 if part proof 
  - $\varnothing$
    > To do this, all we need is an automaton with no final states.
    TODO Here it is still one [deterministic finite automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton#Formal_definition).
    - But all DFAs can be [seen as NFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton#Equivalence_to_DFA).
  - $\{\lambda\}$
    > The nondeterministic automaton in Figure 1(b) shows such a machine.
    here it uses one [DFA_partial_transition_function].
  - $AB$
    > Note that we can assume that SA and SB are disjoint
    if not disjoint, then still do $\cup$ where the duplicate States only exist once.
    - > Start state is sAB = sA, which is final if sA and sB are final.
      here we can see start directly go to $s_B$ which is a final state with input $\epsilon$, so the original graph still holds.
      - It means $𝜆 ∈ A \cap B$
      - > Transition from sB in MB produces a transition from sAB = sA. 
        TODO IMHO this should not be contained except when $s_A$ is final so that we can directly go into $M_B$.
        - It is same as [Elements_of_Theory_of_Computation_2ed_Lewis_Papadimitriou] ~~$s_A\xRightarrow{\epsilon}s_B\xRightarrow{i}(s_B,i)$~~
        - This is also impled in the example 3 $01$ [see][overleaf_automata].
  - $A\cup B$
    - > {sA∪B} if 𝜆 ∈ A ∪ B
      It is implied in $s\xRightarrow{e}s_{1,2}$ in [Elements_of_Theory_of_Computation_2ed_Lewis_Papadimitriou]
  - [Elements_of_Theory_of_Computation_2ed_Lewis_Papadimitriou]
    - $A\cup B$
      - here $(s,e,sl),(s,e,s2)$ are both $e$ so "nondeterministically".
      - $(s,ew)=(s,w)|-_{M}(s_1,w)$
    - $\circ$ see p56 concatenation
    - $AB$ uses $\epsilon$ which the book doesn't use.
    - $A^*$
      - > M consists of the states of M1 and all the transitions of M l ; any final state of M1 is a final state of M
        since the power operation *doesn't incur new states* and other new things.
      - > This new initial state is also final, so that e is accepted.
        implies $e=\lambda=A^0$
      - $s_1'\to s_1$ is to ensure $A^1$ can be run
        and $s_i\in F_1, s_i\to s_1$ is to ensure $A^k\to A_{k+1}$ inductive step.
- example 3 $s_{12}\to s_{17}$ is unnecessary.
  - FIGURE 3 b) removes all replaced states in a).
- [regular set](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/automata_theory/regular_sets.htm) definition
- phrase structure grammar is [related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrase_structure_grammar) with [constituency relation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_grammar#Dependency_vs._phrase_structure) which tries to split the component while dependency tries to concatenate.
- THEOREM 2
  - only if
    - here $a,\lambda,aB$ is included in [Elements_of_Theory_of_Computation_2ed_Lewis_Papadimitriou] p62 regular definition (1),(4),(2).
    - better see the example 4 to see how this works.
  - if
    - > The production S → 𝜆 is included in P if and only if 𝜆 ∈ L(M)
      "only if" is already proved in the above "only if" proof.
      "if" means $\lambda$ is accepted i.e. one terminal forming one accepted string. So $S\to \lambda$.
    - > Because the productions of G correspond to the transitions of M and the productions leading to terminals correspond to transitions to final states
      find the correct mapping between 
      1. "production" and "transition".
      2. "*to* terminal" and "to final state"
        notice here terminal also functions as the input while the final states don't.
    - example 5
      - here $S\to 1,A\to 1$ because $B\to \lambda$ is not allowed.
        so $01$ is not recognized by $S\to 0A,A\to 1B,B\to 1$.
        - or more specifically, we must hava $A\to \alpha$ to *make the production end* where the $\alpha$ is its *last* production implying pointing to the final state.
- EXAMPLE 6
  - > Let s0, s1, s2, … , s2N be the sequence of states that is obtained starting at s0
    here assumes states in the sequence can be same so the minimal path can be any length $\le 2N$.
  - is same as exercise 13.~~4~~3-57 where $n$ is same as here $N$ but it uses $0^{n+1}$ which will bring 
    $s_0\to s_{n+1}$ which has $n+2$ states.
- $\{0^n1^n ∣ n = 0, 1, 2, ... \}$ can be recognized by [the context-free grammar](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28721319/21294350).
  - corresponding [PDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton#Example)
    - Here $AZ,AA$ includes the original top and the pushed symbol.
    - Here [both modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushdown_automaton#Formal_definition) of accepting are met.
### 13.5
- > finite-state automata to compute relatively simple functions such as the sum of two numbers
  [see](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/49348/161388)
- > we can include the five-tuple (s2, 0, s2, 0, R)
  Here we should also have (s2, 1, s2, 1, R) because "(s1, 0, s2, 0, R)" only implies the *old* 0 is unchanged but after R we may have the symbol *0 or 1*.
- > many possible ways to define how to recognize sets using Turing machines
  See [this](https://human.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Philosophy/Sets_Logic_Computation_(Zach)/03%3A_Turing_Machines/12%3A_Turing_Machine_Computations/12.08%3A_Variants_of_Turing_Machines)
  > We allow the machine to write a symbol to the tape and move at the same time, other definitions allow *either writing or moving*.
- EXAMPLE 2
  - > the machine will terminate in the nonfinal state s2
    > will terminate in the final state s3
    So s2 should be similar to s3 where both has no something like $(s2, 0, s2, 0, R)$.
    - Here (s0, B, s2, 0, R) and (s1, B, s2, 0, R) may unnecessarily change tape because we only want to *recognize* strings.
    - Then the machine will *halt* at the *nonfinal* state $s_2$ due to the undefined transition rule, so the string is not recognized.
      So we *also don't need* "(s0, B, s2, 0, R) and (s1, B, s2, 0, R)" where we may halt at the *nonfinal* state $s_{0,1}$.
  - > the bit string has at least two bits and the second bit of the input string is a 1
    "at least two bits" is implied by "(s0, B, s2, 0, R) and (s1, B, s2, 0, R)".
    "the second bit of the input string is a 1" is implied by "(s1, 1, s3, 1, R)".
  - Also see this example which shows the *terminating transition rule* $(s_0, B, s_2, B, R)$ containing 
  $B$
- EXAMPLE 3
  Here "(s3, M, s5, M, R)" is used when "MMMMMM" after "(s2, 1, s3, M, L)" for the 4th symbol 1 in "MMM1MM".
  - Here "(s5, M, s6, M, R)" is to ensure $n\ge 1$ in "$\{0^n1^n ∣ n \ge 1\}$".
- Normally, "number-theoretic function" has positive integer domain instead of the tuple of integers.
- EXAMPLE 4
  Here we have $n_1+1+1+n_2+1$ characters and we want $n_1+n_2+1$ 1s left.
  so "(s0, 1, s1, B, R)" removes the *first* character
  and "(s1, ∗, s3, B, R), (s1, 1, s2, B, R)" removes the *2nd* where "(s1, ∗, s3, B, R)" already has all 1s left so we terminate and 
  after "(s1, 1, s2, B, R)" we need to ensure all left characters are 1s by "(s2, 1, s2, 1, R), and (s2, ∗, s3, 1, R)".

# mcs
- Here I didn't care about more circuit knowledge than already learnt since it is too complex to design one by myself. (skip_circuit)
- Here * sections mean that they are not included in Discrete_Mathematics_and_Its_Applications.
- This book skips most of state machines and Turing machine with only one chapter 6.
- Theorem 8.2.2 is same as DMIA 3.1.6 which finds one *counterexample* using .
  ~~$lang(s)\to H(P,P)$~~ ~~and~~ $s_0=K$
  $s\in/\notin lang(P)$ means halt or not.
  - > Following the usual diagonal approach, we define the language No-halt:
    Here we *iterate over all recognizers* like $A_k$ in the original proof.
    And finds strings not ~~related with~~recognized by all these recognizers like $C$ in the original proof.
    Compared with the original proof
    $\exists m, C=A_m\iff C[k]\neq A_k[k]$ which is wrong because $C[m]=A_m[m]$ contradicts with RHS.
  - > A language is called recognizable when it equals lang.P / for some string procedure P 
    so 'not recognizable' -> 'not halt', i.e. no  program can halt when input such one string/language.
  - DMIA 3.1.6 is almost same as [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/867491/1059606) where `K(K)` is the nested `paradox()`.
    - > there must be a program e that computes g, by the assumption that the model of computation is Turing-complete.
      'Turing-complete' ensures the existence of `e`.
- TODO why 'No-halt' string set is 'non-halting Java programs'
  maybe it is probably one
  $\text{No-halt} \Coloneqq \{s\vert P_s \text{applied to s does not halting}\} = \{s \notin lang(Ps)\}:(8.3)$
- This books seems to have much more typos than DMIA (even wrong hints like Problem 6.6...) and it has many ambiguous description (TODO give one specific example of such one ambiguous description).
  - typo like "more than $\sqrt{n}$ steps" in p361.
## notice
- I only did problems *referred to in the main contents* because some of them are very interesting and Enlightening.
  IMHO they are probably not in IN-CLASS QUESTIONS and ASSIGNMENTS, so not in this [solution](https://github.com/spamegg1/Math-for-CS-solutions?tab=readme-ov-file).
- starting from checking problems in chapter 8 where I have read up to 9.3 finished in mcs.pdf,
  I began reading mcs_2018.pdf (difference between these 2 books see `compare_bmk.awk`)
  TODO compare these [2 files](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/how-to/compare-two-pdf-files.html)
  - The migration may probably began from commit e7d0044d95aa8675c19af4745f24084e7080a59e to .
- From 9.6, if "Lemma 9.6.1", etc, are highlighted, it means their proofs are skipped because of  duplicity with DMIA.
### relation with 6.042J 2019
- currently the following chapter_1-3 problems, chapter_2-2 problems are not in IN-CLASS QUESTIONS or ASSIGNMENTS.
### theorem
- proofs which I learnt in DMIA may be skipped.
  - Theorems proved in DMIA but not in mcs are also skipped.
### solution
- As [this](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science/issues/1090#issuecomment-1282535965) says, the problem may be easy although some are not. But most of them give one detailed hint sequence.

## 1.1~1.8 skipped except for some problems
- Problem 1.26
  - a) trivial
  - b) based on a)
  - c) see [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/3552533/1059606).
  - This is same as DMIA 4-supplementary-23 which is same as the [remark](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/304348/1059606).
- Problem 1.15
  splitting into cases are enough.
- Problem 1.16
  $n=4,m=8$
  $n=6,m=4$
- Problem 1.2 referred to by 9.1.3 Die Hard skipped due to that it is only to be as one reference of "the convention ... the nonnegative square root".
- Problem 1.13 is skipped due to triviality.
## 2.1
- p30 here 
  > the fraction m0=p n0=p cannot be in written in lowest terms either
  is because it equals $\frac{m_0}{n_0}$.
- Theorem 2.2.1 here the *minimal element* is similar to the *base* of induction.
## 2.3
- DMIA uses induction which is same as 5.2.3 (I only give one brief overlook) while the book uses WOP although they are equivalent.
## chapter 2 problems
- Problem 2.20
  $n_s$ is the main part,
  so $n_s+f$ is the minimal family among $n+f$
  then $n_s+f_s$ is the minimal element in this family.
- Problem 2.23 referred to in chapter 6.
  - see [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3548169/1059606) which uses contrapositive to prove.
    - well ordered [implies](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2756184/1059606) total order
## 3 preface
- > we’ll come across the most important open problem in computer science
  may mean SAT
  > It turns out that an efficient solution to SAT would immediately imply efficient solutions to many other important problems
## 3.1
- Here
  > mathematical implications ignore causal connections
  helps ignoring $C_i,i\neq 2,5$ which can therefore extract $C_i,i=2,5$.
## 3.5
- > as with testing validity, this approach quickly bogs down for formulas with many variables
  See 3.3.2
  > There is also a close relationship between validity and satisfiability: a statement P is satisfiable iff its negation NOT.P / is not valid.
- > validity testing is a special case of determining if a formula simplifies to T.
  i.e. all T is one subset of existing one T.
## chapter 3 problems
- Problem 3.16
  - a) 
    $$
    \begin{align*}
      \neg L&\to Q\\
      \neg L&\to B\\
      \neg L&\leftrightarrow N\\
      \text{the above is based on point 1}\\
      \neg Q&\to B\\
      \neg B\\
    \end{align*}
    $$
  - b,c) $B=F\Rightarrow (Q=T,L=T)\Rightarrow N=F$
  - [See](https://www.assignmentexpert.com/homework-answers/mathematics/discrete-mathematics/question-154751) although it only has the correct process for a) and the correct answers for b,c) but not with the correct process.
- Problem 3.6,7 are skipped because they are contained in COD and partly in DMIA.
  And these problems are far from *designing one real CPU* although they are the basis.
- Problem 3.17
  - a) $(A\iff B)=(A \text{ and } B)\text{ or }(\neg A \text{ and } \neg B)$
    xor is similar using the truth table
  - b) [see](https://stackoverflow.com/a/8374918/21294350)
  - c) see DMIA which also contains the above maybe.
- Problem 3.24
  - equisatisfiable diff equivalent see [lec_02](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/_media/fv20/lec02.pdf) from [this](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/fv20/top) ~~which is more readable than~~ which has one different structure but almost the same contents from [2019](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/fv19/top) listed in [this](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/fv)
    - 2019 [lec_03](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/_media/fv19/lec03.pdf)
      - in p14, the latter means $F=T\Leftrightarrow G=T$
        in p13, $FV$ means [all literals p14](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/_media/fv19/lec02-bmc.pdf)
      - propositional logic [compared with syllogistic logic](https://brilliant.org/wiki/propositional-logic/#:~:text=As%20the%20name%20suggests%20propositional,and%20connected%20via%20logical%20connectives.)
        - better see [this](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/sav08/predicate_logic_informally)
    - 2020
      - p17
        see p16 for definition of $FV$ where $\exists$ may introduce [one new variable p8](https://lara.epfl.ch/w/_media/fv20/lec01-main2.pdf).
      - notice here exponentially larger is [only possible][2020_lec_02] but not necessary.
  - b) trivial based on a).
  - notice ["a reduction from 3SAT to Circuit SAT"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circuit_satisfiability_problem#Proof_of_NP-completeness) is much more trivial than the converse direction since the former *doesn't need to introduce new variables*.
    - proof based on [this structure](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4294435/21294350) where $P$ needs [one TM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_(complexity)#Definition) and NP [doesn't see paragraph 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP_(complexity))
  - a)
    - [example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseytin_transformation#Simple_combinatorial_logic)
      - [CNF sub-expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tseytin_transformation#Gate_sub-expressions), take AND for example.
        - based on CNF sub-expression,
          if $C=T$ then we need $A=B=T$ based on the latter 2 components in conjunction.
          else, we need $(A=F) \lor (B=F)$ based on the 1st component.
          The above is same for "Operation".

  - > Explain how, given a set-theoretic equality between two set expressions that is not valid, to *construct a counter-example using any truth assignment* that falsifies the corresponding propositional equivalence
    
    Since we get the final expression, it is easy to show the counter-example or directly show the equality "is not valid". If wanting to make connection with the "truth assignment" anyway, we can use $T\land F\neq T\lor F$ where $(\land,\lor)$ corresponds to $(\cap,\cup)$. Or more  specifically, let $(z\in A \land z\notin B)=T$ and $(z\in A \land z\notin C)=F$.
    ~~We can also use the method implied in the following proof, i.e. .~~
  - > Conclude that any set equality that is valid in a domain of size one will be valid in all domains.
  
    Focus on the 2nd to last equation sequence in p107, we only need to care about each propositional literal like $z\in A$ and the above $\neg z\in A=z\notin A$.
    Then for "a domain of size one" like $\{1\}$ which the problem seems to assume including $\varnothing$
    we choose $z$ as the only element in that set, i.e. $1$ in the above. Then $1\in\{1\}=T,1\in\varnothing=F$. So that for each $z\in A$ we can choose $T$ or $F$.
    Then *all possible* truth assignment for the truth table can be tested in "a domain of size one".

## chapter 6 problems
- Problem 6.6 See above
  - if using induction,
    base: $b=1$ then $\text{quotient}(b,2)=0$, so one transition is enough.
    step: after one step, we need to prove $\overbrace{(\lceil \log (\text{quotient}(b, 2)=\lfloor b/2\rfloor) \rceil+1)}^{IH}+1=\lceil \log b \rceil+1$
      ~~Here when  we can interpret $$~~
      TODO but that may be invalid.
      when `b=0b101`, then $LHS=\log(0b10)+1+1=3$
      while $RHS=\lceil\log(0b101)\rceil+1$
      The key problem is that one side is rounded up while the other isn't.
- Problem 6.22
  | Assignment | rogue couple  |
  | ---------- | ------------- |
  | A-B,R-M    | R-B           |
  | A-M,R-B    | A-R           |
  | ...        | ... similarly |
  The main part is $x-M$ is always the *least* preferable, so $x$ is probably rogue.
  Then only when the other 2 people has the *rank 1* for each other, then one of them $y$ must prefer $x$ more and trivially $x$ prefers $y$ more.
## 7.1
- cons is [not one official operation in Python](https://pypi.org/project/cons/).
- Definition 7.1.3 is based on induction of the length of $s$
  - since $a\in A$, $\langle a, s\rangle=a\cdot s$
    similarly for $a \cdot (t\cdot \lambda)=\langle a, t\cdot \lambda\rangle$
## 7.2
- Definition 7.2.1 Constructor case
  this is very similar to DMIA 13-Supplementary-4, but here the production is from the inner to the outer which is the converse direction.
  - notice Problem 7.20. means same as (ii) in p10 of link1.
  - In sum,
    Lemma after Lemma 7.2.3 and Problem 7.20 combined together have the same process as the [reference p10][2_conditions_for_Balanced_Parentheses] where 1 is trivial to prove.
- here $\cdot's$ means the plural of $\cdot$.
## 7.3*
- Problem 7.25. is not included in DMIA 5.3, 5.4 (exercise 50-57 doesn't show the "well-defined" property).
  See [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/q/96483/1059606) and [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackermann_function#General_remarks)
  based on the above "terminate ..."
  for this problem, 
  (n goes down) $A(m,n-1)$ can be called infinitely until $A(m,1)=2$, 
  (m goes down) then go up one stack $A(m-1,2)=A(m-2,A(m-1,1))=A(m-2,2)=^*A(0,2)=4$. Then we go up one stack again and do $A(m-1,4)=A(m-2,A(m-1,3))=A(m-2,A(m-2,A(m-1,2)))=A(m-2,A(m-2,4))...$ trivially $m$ will always go to 0 and go back stack up.

- TODO Union-Find algorithm
- Definition 7.3.1 implies ordinary induction is almost same as structural induction but the latter allows multiple arguments and is more about *data structure construction* instead of increasing $n$ by one constant step.
  as 7.6 says
  > Structural induction then goes beyond number counting
  - Also see 'The Principle of Structural Induction.'
## 7.5 (maybe *)
- 7.5.2 is more general.
- notice [Theorem 7.5.3.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%27s_theorem_(game_theory)#Details) is not same as 
  > *each* of the players will have a strategy that guarantees a *win or a stalemate*
  because the base will ensure one lose.
- 'Definition. A play of a WL-2PerGm game G' is based on 
  > the situation at any point during game play can itself be *treated as the start* of a new game.
  So the 'Constructor case' is based on length.
  - > Each game M 2 G is called a possible first move of G
    implies G has moves although 'win' and 'lose' moves in base may be insufficient.
- Theorem 7.5.3 Fundamental Theorem for Win-Lose Games
  - > the first player in G becomes the second player in M .
    is based on 
    > So this play of G is a length $n+1$ sequence that finishes with the same outcome
  - better [see this][game_as_decision_tree]
    - This means same as DMIA 11.2 EXAMPLE 6
    - Here Definition 7.5.1 means possible moves make win or lose instead of directly win/lose.
    - > pick M0 as the first move, and then follow the second player’s winning strategy for M0 .
  - Lemma 7.5.2 is same as the top-right part in p1 of [yale_Fundamental_Theorem_for_Win_Lose_Games]
  - > Each game M 2 G is called a possible first move of G.
    here move is generalized to one move which has many small child-moves.
    Then
    > Now if there is a move M0 2 G where the second player in M0 has a winning strategy, then the first player in G has a simple winning strategy: pick M0 as the first move, and then follow the second player’s winning strategy for M0 
    means 'the first player' do one move $k$ which gets to the state $M_0$(i.e. 'pick M0 as the first move').
    **notice** 'move M0' means one game as the above definition and 'as the first move' means one minimal unit move.
    > if the first player in G makes the move M
    means choose $M$ as the above 'pick M0 as the first move'.
  - > Of course only the first move in the meta-chess-tournament is infinite, but then we could set up a tournament consisting of n meta-chess-tournaments.

## 7.6
- > It is then possible to prove properties of data by ordinary induction on their size.
  this is how the book proves 'Fundamental Theorem for Win-Lose Games' compared with [yale_Fundamental_Theorem_for_Win_Lose_Games] where the latter uses 'ordinary induction on their size'.
## 7.6@@
- Definition 7.6.1.
  based on the example of (7.25), the operation is from right to left.
  So when $f\cdot \vec{Q}$, we first do $subtree_T(\vec{Q})$
- proof that Figure 7.4 is one tree with no duplicate nodes.
  at $n$th row starting from 0, it has $2^n$ elements.
  the leftmost is $2^n-1$ and the rightmost is $2 \cdot 2^{n} - 2$
```python
from sympy import Function, rsolve, latex, simplify
from sympy.abc import n
from sympy import init_printing
init_printing()
a = Function('a')
f=a(n)-1-2*a(n-1)
leftmost=rsolve(f, a(n), {a(0):0})
print(latex(leftmost))
f=a(n)-2-2*a(n-1)
rightmost=rsolve(f, a(n), {a(0):0})
print(latex(rightmost))
print(latex(simplify(leftmost-rightmost.subs(n,n-1)))) # so strictly increase between rows.
rightmost-leftmost # strictly increase inside rows.
```
  Since until the rightmost node of the nth row, we have $2^{n+1}-1=\sum_{k=0}^n 2^k$ elements which start from 0 to $2 \cdot 2^{n} - 2$, so their step must be 1.
  - Also see Theorem 7.6.16 which is trivial.
- Compared with DMIA chapter 11, this book says a bit about 'the circular and infinite weirdness' in trees. The former DFS/BFS implicitly avoids 'circular' and it says most of games is finite same as mcs.
- recursive trees is similar to [game_as_decision_tree]
- Theorem 7.6.11
  - $Rec\subseteq Fin$
    > Next we show that T has no shared subtree.
    - focus on what tree is shared
      i.e. in (7.27), whether the $|A\cup B|=|A|+|B|$ (See Lemma 7.6.13.)
      1. $T$ (excluded by finite)
      2. After $T$ is excluded
        we only need to care about $left\cup right$ 
        1. inside left/right (excluded by IH)
        2. between (excluded by def)
  - $Fin\subseteq Rec$
    - Here "an infinite path $f_n,\ldots,f_0$" is possible because they are all not leaves, i.e. they are Branchings.
    - ~~Here we only need to prove one instance of "a shared subtree" for "... or ...".~~
      ~~Then follow the sequence of $\notin$.~~
      Here due to definition we need to check "shared subtree" at each step.
    - > there is no sharing or infinite path in f1.f0 .T //
      sharing implies infinite
  - intuitively `RecTr` decrease the node count at each row one by one until the count becomes 1.
    Notice "the infinite binary tree" ~~has~~ ~~no leaves~~ must have one infinite path down from root because otherwise it is finite. Then we can't get that tree with only leaves and its production backwards.
- See Definition 7.6.9 for `size(T)`.
- $\vec{P}$ in (7.35) is one n-tuple.
- "proof checker" is why we may need "some tedious manipulation" with "The structural induction".
- > searches need not be any longer than log2 of the size of the set of values.
  i.e. $d\le \log_2(s-1)$ in Theorem 7.6.18.
  Then with (7.39) $\log_2(s+1)-1\le d\le \log_2(s-1)$
  so the length can be limited to one small range for "fully balanced" trees which is intuitive.
- > has depth at most log2 n.
  here means $\lfloor \log_2 n\rfloor$
  - See DMIA 11.1 COROLLARY 1 and chapter 11 RESULTS.
- AVL compared with "a fully balanced tree":
  see [the 2nd paragraph](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/131229/161388)
  where the latter cares about subtree while the latter is the entire.
  - This says mainly about [the "normal binary tree" and the "AVL tree"](https://qr.ae/ps5xc0).
- (7.41) assumes $a>0$
- Corollary 7.6.22. is based on `1/math.log((1+math.sqrt(5))/2,2)=1.44` where = means $\approx$
- Definition 7.6.24 is Inorder
- Theorem 7.6.26 proof exercise
  1. T is Leaf,
    "then ..." is included in $ r=num(T) $
    "Otherwise ..." is included in $ r\neq num(T) $ Base case.
  2. T is Branching
    induction based on depth.
    1. $ r=num(T) $ trivial
    2. $r\in nums(left(T))$ (right is similar)
      based on IH, $num(subtree_{left(T)}(srch(left(T),r)))=r(*)$
      then $(*)=num(subtree_{T}(srch(left(T),r)\cdot left))=num(subtree_{T}(srch(T,r)))$
    3. $r\notin nums(left(T))$
      similar to 2, $srch(left(T),r)=fail_l\cdot \vec{P_l}$
      Then we can choose $fail_l\cdot \vec{P_l}\cdot left$ or $fail_r\cdot \vec{P_r}\cdot right$.
### 7.6.4

Here I skipped verification of Problem 7.44,42 because they are about induction which may be tedious and without many creative ideas.
Although Problem 7.43 may be not trivial but it is still based on induction.
- Problem 7.9
  based on Definition 7.1.2 and Lemma 7.1.4 proof.
  - $s=\lambda$ trivial
  - IS (inductive step)
    $$
    #_c(s\cdot t)&=#_c(\langle a,r\cdot t\rangle)\\
                 &=1+#_c(r\cdot t)\\
                 &\overbrace{=}^{IH}1+#_c(r)+#_c(t)\\
                 &\overbrace{=}^{IH}#_c(s)+#_c(t)
    $$
- Problem 7.19
  - a)
    if $s\in \text{ RecMatch}$
    then $s=[t]\Rightarrow$
    - [See](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2926966/1059606)
  - b) trivial based on a) similar to the proof of lemma after Lemma 7.2.3.
    - Also see c)
      $[s]t,t=\lambda\Rightarrow [s]$
      and $st$ of a)
      so RecMatch becomes AmbRecMatch ...
  - c) $s'=[s],s't=[s]t$
    so AmbRecMatch become RecMatch -> RecMatch $\subseteq$ AmbRecMatch
  - The above b,c) is similar to [2_methods_for_balanced_parethesis] but the latter doesn't need the strict equality because it cares about terminals instead of intermediate strings.
    > since you don't need to cover all of these, as long as strings of terminals are covered
- Problem 7.20
  - a) start from
    > If γ is a prefix of β1[S but not β1
    in [2_conditions_for_Balanced_Parentheses]
  - b)
    IMHO "ends with 0" implies $L=R$
    so "good count" is just the "Balanced_Parentheses".
    Then the proof is same as [2_conditions_for_Balanced_Parentheses].
  - Here I didn't prove $\Rightarrow$ as what is done in [2_conditions_for_Balanced_Parentheses] because they are very similar.
- Problem 7.26
  - a) 
    - Environment Model
      $$
      \begin{align*}
        eval(subst(3x, x(x-1)),2)&\to eval(x(x-1),eval(3x, 2))\\
                                 &\to eval(x(x-1),3*2)\\
                                 &\to eval(x,6)*eval(x-1,6)\\
                                 &\to 6*(6-1)
      \end{align*}
      $$
    - Substitution Model
      $$
      \begin{align*}
        eval(subst(3x, x(x-1)),2)&\xrightarrow{\text{See equations between (7.18) and (7.19)}} 
                                  eval(3x(3x-1),2)\\
                                 &\to eval(3x,2)*eval(3x-1,2)\\
                                 &\to (3*2)*((3*2)-1)\\
                                 &\to 6*(6-1)
      \end{align*}
      $$
    - trivially, the 1st one does 3*2 once
      and doesn't manipulate $3x$ many times when $subst(3x, x(x-1))$
      So here 'variable lookup's used in $subst$ is *totally* avoided and multiplication 
  - b) if not taking multiplication in $subst$ in account,
    then $(3*2)*((3*2)-1)$ compared with 
    $eval(x,6)*eval(x-1,6)$ plus $3*2$ has one more multiplication,
    i.e. $2-1$ where $2$ is the substitution count.
    So [$x^{\underbar{7}}$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_and_rising_factorials) instead of $x(x-1)$ will work.
  - c) see [this](./others/mcs/7_26.md)
- I skipped the reference Problem 4.7 because it is only shown as one game where we don't care what it is detailedly.
- Problem 7.36
  - All of the following proof is a bit less trickier than [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#Proof_of_the_winning_formula)
    - "the usual associative and commutative" combined together means we can choose *any 2* of all elements to calculate firstly. So we have the 4th $=$.
    - Ignores "These strategies for normal play and a misère game are the same until the number of heaps with at least two objects is exactly equal to one. ..." part because it may be impossible. See the following SE answer.
  - This is implied very implicitly in DMIA 11.2-39,40.
  - Here I follow the terms used in Problem 8.42
  - I skip Problem 3.6 because it seems to be only one reference for the carry.
  - a) ~~trivial for the next player~~
    ~~for the ~~
    ~~assume not, i.e. after one move for one pile, then the changed pile number binary representation~~
    To keep still zero, we need each bit of the changed pile number kept *unchanged*. That's  impossible.
  - b) make that one become "the Nim sum"
    then $a\oplus a=0$
  - c) if equal, by b) that's impossible.
    See this
    this just means that pile has that "most significant binary digit" set but not for "the Nim sum of the all the other piles", so that pile is bigger.
  - d)
    as b) says, "the first player" does one move to let the "Nim sum" become zero.
    then the 2nd player will again let "Nim sum" "not zero"
    then recursively, since the total number of stones strictly decreases, at last "the first player" will have one move to get to the zero stones (i.e. one  special case of the zero "Nim sum")
  - e) 
    see [the last diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim#Mathematical_theory)
    trivially the piles disappear one by one.
    See [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4906435/1059606)
- Problem 7.44
  - base case: trivially since $T$ is the leaf, so $\vec{P}=\lambda$
  - Constructor case:
    Suppose $\vec{P}=(f_n,\ldots,f_0)$
    $subtree_T(\vec{P})=subtree_{f_0\cdot T}((f_n,\ldots,f_1))$
    let $\vec{P'}=(f_n,\ldots,f_1)$
    Then
    $$
    \begin{align*}
      \text{depth}(T)&=\ldots&(7.35)\\
                     &=|(f_0)|+\max\{\vec{P'}\ldots\}&(\text{def of tuple})\\
                     &=1+\max\{\text{depth}(\text{left}(T))\ldots\}&(\text{see above})\\

- Problem 7.40 (trivial so with no verification online)
  - Since in Figure 7.5, depth(R)=d/d+1, depth(U)=d+1
    So it included the case in Figure 7.13
  - In a summary here we just find one method to break the pair (B,S) by categorization.
  - Here the bottom level is d/d-1 where at most one is d-1. Then "AVL tree" is trivial. The rest is same as Figure 7.5

    - Identity of Monoid/algebraic structure is Unique is based on [the definition of Identity][Identity_Unique].
- > the range [0..n)

  This ring [see](https://www.math.uci.edu/~ndonalds/math120b/2poly.pdf)
  similar to the above, it is ring because its operation is ~~based on~~ almost same as those operations in $\mathbb{N}$.
- > On the other hand, the set fT; Fg of truth values with OR for addition and AND for multiplication is not a commutative ring because it fails to satisfy one of these equalities.

## 9.9
DMIA 4.1 only says in brief in th end.
- Lemma 9.9.1 see DMIA 4.4 THEOREM 1.
  - Here [$\gcd(0,n)=n$](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1156819/1059606), so 0 and 1 are relatively prime.
- 0 [relatively prime](https://www.splashlearn.com/math-vocabulary/relatively-prime#:~:text=0%20and%201%20are%20relatively,is%20divisible%20by%20any%20integer.) to 1 based on definition.
- Theorem 9.9.5
  > if k is not relatively prime to n, then we can show it isn’t cancellable
  Assume this is $A\to B=\neg (A\land\neg B)=T$
  so $A\land\neg B=F$
  i.e. Assume A and $\neg B$ "it *is* cancellable", we need contradiction.
  - See [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4910592/textif-1-neq-gcdc-m-textthen-ac-equiv-bc-pmod-m-nrightarrow#comment10484446_4910592) where we only needs one counterexample.
- Riemann Hypothesis
  - [relation](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1922389/1059606) with the prime distribution.
    - notice "The second Chebyshev function" has [2 $\sum$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_function) which causes $\log_p x$
    - $\ge$ is based on $\log_p x\ge 1$ and $x^{1-\epsilon}\le p$.
      TODO the last equality from $\pi(x)-\pi(x^{1-\epsilon})$
    - "The next step ..." is  temporarily dropped.

      Notice here we add $n$ itself due to the definition which also makes the elegant $\Prod$ possible (otherwise we need to remove one term which will make it impossible to be expressed in  multiplication of sum).
    - > This means that m is prime and its only two divisors are itself (m) and one (M)
      because this is the minimal state. So prime.
- Problem 9.13 trivial here give one sketch.
  Also [see](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4911211/1059606) which I only gives one overlook because that is not very helpful with much redundant information.

- Problem 9.61 is skipped due to duplicity.
- Problem 9.64
  - a) trivial based on the *unique solution* using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.
  - b) since $ab$ only has $1,a,b,ab$ factors
    $\gcd(k,ab)=\gcd(k,a)=\gcd(\text{rem}(k,a),a)=1$, so the function is well-defined.

    Since $y\le n-2\Rightarrow y+1\le n-1$
    trivially $(p\mid y+1)\vee(q\mid y+1)$ since otherwise $n\mid y-1<n$ is impossible where $y\neq 1$.
    Then $0<y+1\le n-1$ also excludes $(p\mid y+1)\land(q\mid y+1)$
  - TODO why 4 square roots modulo n.

  One different method (maybe not one refinement) based on Warshall’s algorithm (by adding $v_k$ successively) is said in DMIA 9.4-32.
## 10.4
- (10.9) Here it may think $G$ doesn't contain the "identity relation".
  $G\cup G^0$ is needed due to there is no length 1 walk from a to a except for the self-loop which doesn't always exist.
  But for length-k $k>1$ walks, they must be based on length-1 recursively.
  So $(G\cup G^0)^{|V(G)|-1}$ will contain all walks with length $1<n<|V(G)|-1$.
## 10.5* (not said in DMIA but is read in GeeksforGeeks)
- See [get_Topological_Sorting_from_DAG] and [DAG_to_topological_ordering_proof]

  This is solved in DMIA [Dilworth_theorem_proof_wikipedia].
  "disjoint chains" -> "the smallest chain decomposition" is $n/t$ when "a chain of size not greater than t".
## 10.6
- Definition 10.6.7 may assume Asymmetry since it is based on digraph.
- Theorem 10.6.8 "only if" seems to be wrong since the domain of $R$ may be not vertices except that we geenralize everything as vertices like the former example seeing clothes as vertices.
- in Corollary 10.6.11 ~~may be~~ [~~not precise~~](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_relation#Definition), it combines the [irreflexive, asymmetric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set#Strict_partial_orders) [together](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_relation) since the definition of "asymmetric" includes $a=b$ case so that $aRa$ doesn't hold.
## 10.7

## chapter 10 problems
Many of problems later are not verified. Only those I really have doubts may be verified on Stack Exchange / Stack Overflow.
- Problem 10.3 @#@
  - a) suppose by contradiction $x$ is not on.
    ~~then $dist (u, x) + dist (x, v)>dist (u, v)$ leading to the contradiction with "shortest path"~~
    ~~or $dist (u, x) + dist (x, v)<dist (u, v)$ leading to the contradiction with $dist(u,v)$.~~
    Since "dist (u, x) + dist (x, v)" defines one "shortest path" = dist (u, v). 
    Then $x$ is on that path.
  - b) if x is on a shortest path from u to v, then it must take the shortest from u to x and x to v (otherwise that path is not shortest).

    - "nonbacktracking" may mean not going back by verbatim.
      This is implied by the example in the answer.
    - IMHO nonbacktracking ensures circuit and then non-lazy ensures cycle.
    - notice this answer is correct about the *necessary* additional conditions.
    - Here cycle *uses wikipedia definition* based on circuit.
  - IMHO here a) and b) seems to be in conflict.

        the above seems to be true.

- Problem 10.11

  - (a) suppose " when j < k, *one* vertex in Aj is reachable from any vertex in Ak"
    Then $A_j$ should has at least depth $k>j$ leading to the contradiction.

- Problem 10.26
  - (a) trivial by definition
  - (b) since we must do $n-(t-1)$ bottom tasks first if possible with $n-(t-1)$ number of processors
    and then follow the chain of $t-1$ tasks which is the minimal steps to do due to dependency.
    Since each step is determined, it is unique.

    $$
    - $t,p\ge n-(t-1)$ is contained in the above.
  - (d)
    base: $t=1$ trivial since each step we have at most $p$ tasks.
    induciton: IMHO the above $M$ is specific for $D_{n,t}$ and doesn't work for other situations like the possibility for filling the above gap when some of the next level can be in parallel with the rest in the former level.

- Problem 10.37
  - (a) 
    1-to-1: for each $L(a)$, there must be one maximum element which is $a$.
    onto: see the above.
  - (b)
    only if: $x\preceq a\preceq b\Rightarrow x\preceq b$ by transitive property.
      i.e. $x\in L(a)\Rightarrow x\in L(b)$, so $L(a)\subseteq L(b)$
    if: similarly we have $x\preceq a\Rightarrow x\preceq b (*)$
      if $\neg(a\preceq b)$, then either $a$ and $b$ are incomparable or $b\prec a$
      both cases can't ensure $(*)$
- Problem 10.38
  - (a)
    only if: similar to 37, first we prove $\subseteq$.
      $aRb\Rightarrow a\in L(b)$
      $xRaRb\Rightarrow x\in L(b)$
      then we show $\exists y\in L(b),y\notin L(a)$
      just choose $y=b$ since $bRa$ and $aRb$ can't hold ~~when $aRb\Rightarrow a\neq b$.~~ for Asymmetry.
    if: we have $a\in L(b)$, then $a\neq b$ (otherwise $L(a)=L(b)$ trivially), so we have $aRb$.
  - (b)
    similar to (a), we have $a\in L(b)$,
      if $a=b$, then all is fine.
      if $a\neq b$, we must have $aRb$. Then similarly $bRa$ leading to contradiction since $R$ is Asymmetric.
  - (c)
    if $A=\{1,2,3\},1R2,1R3$ where "asymmetric" and "transitive" hold vacuously, then $L(2)=L(3)$ but $2\neq 3$.
- Problem 10.52
  - (a)
    1. by definition $(a_1,a_2)(R_1\times R_2)(a_1,a_2)\text{ iff }[a_1 R_1 a_1\land a_2 R_2 a_2]$
      Since RHS is T, ...
    2. by definition $(a_1,a_2)(R_1\times R_2)(b_1,b_2)\land(b_1,b_2)(R_1\times R_2)(a_1,a_2)\Rightarrow (a_1 R_1 b_1\land b_1 R_1 a_1) \ldots\Rightarrow a_1=b_1\ldots\Rightarrow (a_1,a_2)=(b_1,b_2)$
    3. similar to 2 but use $a_1 R_1 b_1 R_1 c_1\ldots\Rightarrow a_1 R_1 c_1\ldots\Rightarrow (a_1,a_2)(R_1\times R_2)(c_1,c_2)$
  - (b)
    based on (a) $R_1\times R_2$ is ~~partial order.~~ transitive.
    WLOG suppose $R_1$ is strict.
    Then $a_1 R_1 b_1\Rightarrow \neg(b_1 R_1 a_1)\Rightarrow \neg((b_1,b_2)(R_1\times R_2)(a_1,a_2))$. So Asymmetry
    Then strict.
- Problem 10.58
  - (a)
    trivially by $=$ has all 3 properties.
  - (b)
    $f .a/ D R.a/$ is got from $f(a)$ definition.
    - See the [Math-for-CS-solutions](./others/mcs/sol/Math-for-CS-solutions/MIT6_042JS15_cp18_solutions.pdf).
      - > The proof of the converse a ≡f b IMPLIES aRb is very similar.
        $a\in f(a)$ trivially, so we have $a\in f(b)\Rightarrow bRa\Rightarrow aRb$
- Problem 10.57
  - This is shown in DMIA 9.5.4 THEOREM 1 context.
    - (a) trivial. at least $a\in [a]_R$
    - (b) trivial by the transitive property.
      - $a R b\Rightarrow [a]_R=[b]_R$ so every element is only in one $[a]_R$.
        by Definition 10.5.6, $[a]_R$ is a partition.
    - (c) both directions by transitive property.
       similar to (b) in Problem 10.58.
## 11.1
- Here is one *special* [complete binary tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)
- > In a tree there is a unique path between every pair of vertices
  This is proved in DMIA 11.1 THEOREM 1.
- $\pi(i)$ is to ensure bijection from $[0..N-1]$ to $[0..N-1]$.
## 11.2
- > This is nearly the best possible with 3  3 switches.
  - TODO see [this one with router](https://serverfault.com/a/150086/1032032) and [this](https://community.spiceworks.com/t/most-efficient-way-to-connect-three-network-switches/950173/2)
- > all paths are the same length
  ~~because all from the bottom level to the bottom level, the *longest* is trivially .~~
  $(IN_{0},OUT_{1})$ latency is different from $(IN_{0},OUT_{3})$.
- > By extending the notion of congestion to networks, we can also distinguish be-tween “good” and “bad” networks with respect to bottleneck problems.
  because congestion occurs when packets flood up which imply the bottleneck.
## 11.3
- 2-D
  - notice Theorem 11.3.1 is based on permutation. So $in_{0\sim 3}\to out_0$ is impossible which may cause the congestion to 4.
  - notice switch size of 2-D may only use 1x2 for some switches.
- Butterfly
  - TODO it seeems to be read in COD / csapp.
  - > 2nC1 .n C 1/ of columns.
    should be $2^{n+1}(n+2)$ for $F_{n+1}$.
    - Then $n+2$ columns -> $n+1$ length
      > from an input switch to an output is length-n C 1
  - By "new inputs" in Figure 11.5, we can get "switch size".
- Lemma 11.3.3
  - The book Beneš is not totally same as [the wikipedia one](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clos_network#Bene%C5%A1_network_(m_=_n_=_2)).
  - Theorem 12.8.3
    "only if" is trivial which is already shown in DMIA.
    "if" non-cycle must be colored by 2-colors.
    - 2. IMPLIES 3
      - > there will be a walk wu starting at u and ending at r
        this should be shortest walk to ensure uniquity.
        we can color radially from $r$.
      - > So there must be an edge between two nodes u and v with the same color.
        this implies $u,v$ are adjacent. So $|w_u|-|w_v|=2n,n\in\mathbb{N}$.
    - 3. IMPLIES 1
      - This is also implied in Lemma 10.2.6.
    - Notice here if using only "every cycle in it has even length" to show it can be "2-colorable" may be more difficult since it is more easy to find one counterexample than proving valid in all cases.
      i.e. $\exists$ ~~is~~ may probably be easy for $\forall$.
      See [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4910599/1059606)
  - Case 1 ~~can be seen as a single edge as one connected component.~~ See $2-6$ in the  example.
  - > a unique edge hu—vi 2 E1 and a unique edge hu—wi 2 E2 .
    i.e. one in the leftmost and one in the rightmost column.
## chapter 11 problems
- Problem 11.8
  - Assume column 0 is the leftmost column
    then 
    > there is a path from ex-actly 2i input vertices to v
    is trivial by the recursive construction from $i=1$.
    And
    > a path from v to exactly 2n i output vertices.
    is similar.
  - Since the related input/output vertices w.r.t column $i$ is $\min(2^i,2^{n-i})$
    so the congestion will be $2^{n/2}=\sqrt{2^n}=\sqrt{N}$ at column $n/2$.
  - odd:
    similarly $\min(2^i,2^{n-i})$ will take max when $i=(n\pm 1)/2$
    so the congestion will be $2^{(n-1)/2}=\sqrt{N/2}$.
