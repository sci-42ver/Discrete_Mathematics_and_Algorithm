IMHO, John L. and vonbrand's answers are based on adding *one* 0 or 1. Here I give one solution based on adding *two* 0's or 1's and *transpositions*.

This problem is same as exercise 13.1-15-c) in Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications 8th by Kenneth Rosen. The answer given by the book is 
> $S \to AAS, S \to BBS, AB \to BA, BA \to AB, S \to \lambda, A \to 0, B \to 1$

1. prove "It does not generate any string that is not in L." in John L.'s answer.

   When at some time $S$ disappears, the expression becomes $\displaystyle\overbrace{AA\cdots AA}^{2\cdot k_1\text{ times}}\overbrace{BB\cdots BB}^{2\cdot k_2\text{ times}}\cdots\overbrace{AA\cdots AA}^{2\cdot k_{m-1}\text{ times}}\overbrace{BB\cdots BB}^{2\cdot k_m\text{ times}},k_i\ge 0,1\le i\le m$.

   Although in the above process we can exchange $AB$ and using productions $A\to 0,B\to 1$, but that doesn't influence the final result if we defer these exchanges later. So we only do productions with only $S$ at the left.

   (Notice this method of eliminating S first can be generalized at least ~~to all type-3,2,1 grammars where $S$ only ~~ for those grammars where $S$ is not in ${\displaystyle \alpha A\beta \rightarrow \alpha \gamma \beta }$)

3. Then we need to show "It generate every string in L."

   Here "even number" is already met. Then we need to show *all possible permutations* of these 0's and 1's can be generated. Based on [this QA](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/4338566/1059606) we only need to show we can form *all possible transpositions*. ([proof](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3995056/1059606) of "Any permutation breaks down into cycles")

   - Assume *one arbitrary transposition*: we want to exchange $p_1$-th B (denote it with $B_{p_1}$) 
     in $\overbrace{BB\cdots BB}^{2\cdot k_m\text{ times}}$ and 
     $p_0$-th A (similarly denoted with $A_{p_0}$) in $\overbrace{AA\cdots AA}^{2\cdot k_1\text{ times}}$.
     1. we can make $B_{p_1}$ location filled with 
        $A$ by using $p_1$ times $AB\to BA$ which will make the last $A$ in the preceding $\overbrace{AA\cdots AA}^{2\cdot k_{m-1}\text{ times}}$ 
        (denote this preceding sequence with $M$)
        filled with $B$.

        (This is a bit like moving $B_{p_1}$ to *the last location* 
        in the preceding sequence $M$.)
     2. To make $A_{p_0}$ location filled with 
        $B$ and *let the others unchanged*, after doing point 1, we can use $2\cdot k_{m-1}-1$ times $AB\to BA$ to make the last $B$ of sequence $M$ moved to *the first location* of the original sequence $M$.

        (This is a bit like moving $B_{p_1}$ to *the first location* 
        in the preceding sequence $M$.)

        Then use the operations of point 1, we can move this B again to *the last location* of $\overbrace{AA\cdots AA}^{2\cdot k_{m-3}\text{ times}}$ which also make 
        $M$ as its original view.

        Then iteratively, we can move $B_{p_1}$ to the last location of 
        $\overbrace{AA\cdots AA}^{2\cdot k_1\text{ times}}$ from where we can make $A_{p_0}$ location filled with 
        $B$.
      - The above is same as [wikipedia][cycle_to_transpositions] says
         > This follows because an arbitrary transposition can be expressed as the product of *adjacent transpositions*.
         - ~~Here it means in [Two-line notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation#Two-line_notation) z is mappped to b, but ~~
            > the permutation (3, 1, 2) is described by the function ${\displaystyle \sigma }$ defined as ...
            ~~Here $\sigma(n)$ is ~~the $n$-th element after reordered.~~ mapping $n$ to $\sigma(n)$~~
            So 
            > This has moved ${\displaystyle z}$ to the position of ${\displaystyle b,}$
            means $\sigma(z)=b$ but it doesn't mean the position of b (c is at the position of b). It means b is at the position of z.
            in [this][cycle_to_transpositions],
            ```bash
            abcd...yz 
            acde...zb # by (bcd...yz)
            bcde...za # by (ab)

              # not commutative
            abcd...yz
            bacd...yz # by (ab)
            cade...zb
            ```
      - Here adjacent transpositions $AA\to AA,BB\to BB$ will be done vacuously.
   Then by doing transpositions multiple times, we can get all permutations of even numbers of 0's and 1's.
