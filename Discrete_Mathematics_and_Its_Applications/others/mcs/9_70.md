This is similar to [one similar QA][2] which proves the above using contradiction. But that method is different from the following.

Problem 9.70 in [spring18 mcs.pdf][1]

> Lemma 9.2.1. For $b \neq 0$,
$$
\gcd(a, b) = \gcd(b, \text{rem}(a, b))
$$

$\cdot_n$ and $+_n$ operations:
> $$
i +_n j ::= \text{rem}(i + j,n),\\
i \cdot_n j ::= \text{rem}(ij,n).
$$

The book simplify the above notations sometimes:
> These subscript-n’s on arithmetic operations really clog things up, so instead
we’ll just write “$(\mathbb{Z}_n)$” on the side to get a simpler looking equation:
$$
(i \cdot j ) \cdot k = i \cdot (j \cdot k) (\mathbb{Z}_n).
$$

In the following "cancellable" definition (only [assume left](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancellation_property) although "two-sided" also works), $\mathbb{Z}_n$ means the ring of integer modulo n.
> Definition 9.9.3. A number k is cancellable in $\mathbb{Z}_n$ iff
$$
k \cdot a = k \cdot b\quad \text{implies}\quad a = b (\mathbb{Z}_n)
$$
for all $a, b \in [0..n)$.

For (a), $k_1^{-1}k_1k_2^{-1}k_2\equiv 1\equiv k_1^{-1}k_2^{-1}(k_1\cdot_n k_2)\pmod n$ (Here we use $k^{-1}$ as the notation for the inverse modulo n of $k$). So we have the  inverse $k_1^{-1}k_2^{-1}$ for $k_1\cdot_n k_2$ when modulo $n$

For (b), we have $k_1k_2a\equiv k_1k_2b\pmod n\Rightarrow a\equiv b\pmod n$. So we have $k_1\cdot_n k_2a\equiv k_1\cdot_n k_2b\pmod n\Rightarrow a\equiv b\pmod n$, i.e. $k_1\cdot_n k_2$ is cancellable modulo n.

(a) and (b) are almost same because these 2 methods are equivalent as Theorem 9.9.5 says where the former 2 equivalence can proved as [this QA answer](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2670313/1059606) says:
> The following are equivalent for $k \in [0..n):$
$$
\gcd(k, n) = 1,\\
k \text{ has an inverse in }  \mathbb{Z}_n ,\\
k \text{ is cancellable in } \mathbb{Z}_n .
$$

For (c), I found it is similar to [Chinmay Nirkhe's comment][2] although without using Lemma 9.2.1. But IMHO $k_1\cdot_n k_2$ may not have "prime factors" in $A_1\cup A_2$ where $A_{i}$ is the set of prime factors of $k_i$.

My thoughts about (c): Lemma 9.2.1 will not duplicate RHS as LHS only when $a>b$. So if using that Lemma, then we need to manipulate with 4 cases about the relation between $k_{1,2}$ and $n$. That's maybe *more complicate* than (a,b). When using the Unique Factorization Theorem, I can't connect factors of $k_1\cdot_n k_2$ with $k_{1,2}$ because the former is constrained in $[0,n)$ while the latter doesn't.

Q:

How to follow the hints of (c) to solve with Problem 9.70 elegantly?
