# Exercises
I only read even ones because [they][SOLUTIONS_8th] have detailed explanation as [7th][SOLUTIONS_7th] and also odd ones are very similar to even ones at least for 1.1 (except for some cases that even ones are a little hard whether having asterisk marks or not).
I also read the asterisked ones.
- I skipped all [assessments](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/125967651x/student_view0/self_assessments.html) because examples plus exercises are enough.
- I skipped all REVIEW QUESTIONS due to 
  1. not finding valuable answers although [SOLUTIONS_7th] has some tips.
  2. exercises are enough large to help the learning.
- COMPUTER PROJECTS , COMPUTATIONS AND EXPLORATIONS and WRITING PROJECTS are a bit off the topic with the goal to learn the **maths** fundamental knowledge.
- The following *skipped* ones are based on that after I thought of the exercise and checked the ans, the ans shows the same or similar to what I thought, so I didn't spend redundant time to record the more deeper understanding about the exercise.
- ~~p22 table 1 exercise list: I only did the necessary ones needed at Pages Where Used.~~
  See my green underlined contents in p22 table 1
  How are these exercises related with underline used?
- 2.3-p159
  > Proofs of the other properties are left as exercises
  2.2-p136
  > The proofs of the remaining identities will be left as exercises
  - 5.5-p397
    > The details will be left as an exercise for the reader
    It is same as the book outline $p\{S_1\}q\dots$.
  - Some other "left as (an) exercise(s)" are contained in this note
  - The above is skipped because of similarity with the other exercises and triviality.
- * means unread.
## 1
### 1.1
- [x] 
  a,b,d,f not.
- 4~16,
  24~40,46 skipped for it to be a little too unnecessary and trivial.
- see answer for 18
- [ ] a,b true because premise is false.
- [ ] a,b,c -> inclusive or
- [x] 42 assume one pair is different, then can be proved easily.
  if they are all same, it is also easy to prove the equation holds.
- [x] 43 trivial by thinking each case of $\wedge$.
- [x] 44 because if not, then one pair of all true will make the statement false.
- [ ] 45 $\underset{i=1}{{\overset{n-1}{\bigvee}}}\underset{j=i+1}{{\overset{n}{\bigvee}}}$
- [ ] 52 yes
- [ ] 53
  a) only one is true
  b) undetermined value
  c) 
  modification after reading the answer
  a) so 99th is true
  b) if "at least n" is true, then true for all $i<=n$ (i.e. n false and $100-n$ true -> $100-n=n$ -> $n=50$)
  c) see b), $99-n=n$ is impossible for $n\in\mathbb{Z}$
### 1.2
- 2,6~8,12 skipped because similar to 10,
  14 just based on keywords
  18 (because not automatic proof, it just traverses all conditions)
  24 (just use the exhaustion method)
  28~35 they are similar to 24,26 and they have little differences among themselves.
- [ ] 4 $d\vee s \to w$
- [ ] 10 yes TFT (maybe true)
- [ ] 19 the 2rd subquestion is to test [whether the man is liar](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/2346364/1059606) based on 1st, [detailed](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34574728/21294350).
  more [intuitive](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3021648/1059606) where no/yes from whether liar or TRUTHTELLER is *same*.
- [ ] 20
  1. if "yes", then he is liar -> he is not liar based on contrary "yes", i.e. no. (Then contradiction)
    "no" is ~~similar~~.
  2. 
  - Ans
    1. Above is wrong.
    2. similar to 19.
- [ ] 22 TFF
  ~~TODO how~~ “unless” 
  1. means “or.”
  2. `->` based on p30.
  TODO IMHO, should be $p\to q$, i.e. $\neg j\to \neg k$
- [ ] 26 two cases (both knights / both knaves) are possible.
- [ ] 36
  since what Smith said is neutral, so assume he is true.
  if Jones is true, then Williams is wrong.
  - ans
    ~~b) just same as a) because the added statements is obvious.~~
- [ ] 38 can also use $\oplus$
- [ ] 40 also "the exhaustion method".
- [ ] TODO 42 [unavailable](https://web.archive.org/web/20020401000000*/http://mathforum.org/dr.math/problems/joseph8.5.97.html)
  based on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zebra_Puzzle#Solution), just step by step solve the problem.
  TODO where is in [Life International](https://books.google.co.jp/books?id=elIEAAAAMBAJ&q=zebra#v=onepage&q=zebra&f=false)
### 1.3
- 2~12,18,
  50~52 are skipped.
  14,16 I only read the 1st one.
  20~37 I only read 20 because they are probably similar.
- [x] 11 trivial by table.
- [x] 19 $p=T,q=F$
  $p\to q$ is $F$
  then $F\to F$ is true
  - assume not tautology, then $T\to F$
    then $p=T$ and $q=F$ due to $\neg q$ is $T$
    then contradiction due to that $p\to q$ is $F$.
- [ ] 40 has no referenced symbols.
  TODO
  1. the ans doesn't show the compound proposition, also for the above self answer.
- [ ] 42 TODO why they are held simultaneously.
- [x] 44 obviously by $\wedge$.
- [ ] 46 just based on the meaning of disjunction and conjunctions
  where disjunction allows all possibilities
  and conjunction ensures the needed conditions with one specific possibility.
- [x] 48 the hint has given the answer.
  49 just the opposite step of 48.
- [x] 54
  a. truth table
  b. $\neg (p\downarrow q)\ldots$
  c. based on 49 and the above is enough.
- [x] 55 $\neg(\neg p\downarrow q)$
  then $((p\downarrow p)\downarrow q)\downarrow((p\downarrow p)\downarrow q)$
- [x] 56 same as $\downarrow$
  $p|p=\neg p$
  $(p|q)|(p|q)=\neg (p|q)=p\wedge q$
  - the ans based on $\vee$ is also ok.
- [ ] 58 see the answer.
- [x] 59 $2^4$
- [x] 60 transitivity.
- [x] 62 5
- [x] 64 $\neg F=T; \neg T=F$
- [x] 66
  a($p=T,s=F$),b($p=F=s,q=T$),c($p=T=q=s,r=F$)
- [ ] 68 $Q\wedge\underset{i\in odd}{\vee}p(i,1)$
  all is not in even -> in one of odd.
- [x] 70 $\underset{i=1}{\overset{9}{\bigwedge}}\underset{j=1}{\overset{9}{\bigwedge}}\underset{n=1}{\overset{9}{\bigvee}}p(i,j,n)$
- [x] 72
  where $r,s$ traverse the 9 blocks
  $n$ ensures each number is assigned
  $i,j$ traverse inside the block
### 1.4
1. [null quantification](https://gateoverflow.in/130504/null-qunatification-rule#:~:text=Null%20Quantification%20mean%20when%20a,in%20part%20of%20a%20statement.) means some statement like $A$ in 48 doesn't have quantified variable like $x$ in 48.
- 2~6,
  12~16,
  22,26,
  28~30(similar to exercises before),
  32~44,54,
  58~64 skipped
- [x] 8
  a. rabbit hops
  b. all animals are rabbits and hops
  c. there is some animals are rabbits and they hop.
  d. there is some animals are rabbits which hop.
- [ ] 10 better with parentheses
  a. $\exists xC(x)\wedge D(x)\wedge F(x)$
  b. $\forall xC(x)\wedge D(x)\wedge F(x)$ wrong ("or")
  c. $\exists xC(x)\wedge \neg D(x)\wedge F(x)$ 
  d. $\neg (\exists xC(x)\wedge D(x)\wedge F(x))$
  e. $\exists xC(x)\vee D(x)\vee F(x)$ This is same as the answer.
- [x] 18
  $\exists \Rightarrow \vee$
  $\forall \Rightarrow \wedge$
  $\neg$ just assign to each predicate
- [x] 20 
  a,b similar to 18
  c~e see the ans is enough.
- [x] 24
  same as the examples,
  $\forall \Rightarrow \to$ to exclude the result as the condition
  $\exists \Rightarrow \wedge$ to include the result as the condition -> b,c,e
- [ ] 46 yes based on 45.
  45 is by definition.
  - 45 ans
    $T/F \to  F$ false because $T\to F$ is false
    $F\to F$ true
  - 46 similar
- [ ] 48 by definition
  a. any ... or ... means any (... or ...)
- [x] 50
  a. only A is T and P(x) is F -> false
    same for the right side, Q.E.D.
- [ ] 52 -> ans
- [ ] 56
  inspired by p57
  at least $\underset{i=1}{\overset{3}{\bigvee}}P(i)$
  at most $\underset{i=1}{\overset{2}{\bigwedge}}\underset{j=i+1}{\overset{3}{\bigwedge}}(\neg P(i)\wedge \neg P(j))$
  - ans just the exhaustion method
### 1.5
- 2~8,
  14~32,
  36~42,46,52(similar to 17) are skipped
- [ ] 10
  PO IMHO here $\rightarrow$ can also be $\leftrightarrow$
- [ ] 12
  j. here chat -> connection is wrong so no $\leftarrow$
  k. maybe here ~~assume~~ self has chatted with self is nonsense. ~~so not chat ~~can't~~ -> $x\neq y$~~
  so $x\neq y$ is just the condition and should be thought as the result, so no $\leftarrow$
- [ ] 17
  d. $\exists x \exists y (x\neq y\wedge\forall z(M(x,z)\wedge M(y,z)))\wedge \forall a(\forall z M(a,z)\to (x=a\vee y=a))$
  - the ans is more elegant.
- [x] 34
  just $1,2$
  and $1,2,3$
- [ ] 44
  also can use methods similar to 17.
- [x] 48 replace $x$ with $y$ and then truth table
- [ ] 49 similar to 48
  a. since $P(x)=T$, so become $\exists xQ(x)$ -> $\exists yQ(y)$
  b. similar to a
- [ ] 50
  a. $\exists x(P(x)\vee Q(x) \vee A)$
  | x   | P(x) | Q(x) |
  | --- | ---- | ---- |
  | x1  | T    | F    |
  | x2  | F    | T    |
  | ... |      |      |

  b. $\exists x \neg(P(x)\vee Q(x))$
  c. see ans.
  $\neg (\exists xP(x)\wedge(\neg \exists xQ(x)))$ ->
  $\neg (\exists xP(x)\wedge(\forall x \neg Q(x)))$ ->
  $\forall x \neg P(x) \vee(\exists x Q(x))$
- [ ] 51
  by 50 and exercises before
  1. connectives are enough for $\neg,\vee$
  2. 50 has includes $\exists,\forall,\to$
  then Q.E.D.
  - The ans proves that 
    1. $QxP(x)$
    2. $\neg P(x)$
    3. $P\vee Q$
    all be transformed into PNF
    Then based on the *order*, just one by one transform is enough.
### 1.6
- 2~6,10,14&16&20(I only read a),30 skipped
  here 12,22 is a little different from the ans but the logic is not wrong IMHO.
- [ ] 8
  can also based on "if x is an island, then x is No man".
  so Hypothetical syllogism
- [ ] 12
  (p ∧ t) →(r ∨ s), q →(u ∧ t), u →p, and ¬s and conclusion q →r
  $q\to u\to p$
  $q\to t$
  so
  $q\to (p ∧ t) \to (r ∨ s)$, since $\neg s$, so $q\to r$
  - see ans better use 11 based on what the exercise says.
- [x] 18 why $S(M,M)$
- [ ] 22
  based on $p\to q\equiv \neg p\vee q$ based on the *unique false* result
  $$
  \newcommand{\myrightarrow}[1]{{\overset{#1}{\xRightarrow{\hspace{7cm}}}}}
  \begin{align*}
  \neg \exists x(Q(x)\wedge  R(x))&\myrightarrow{\neg(T\wedge T)=F\Rightarrow T\to \neg T=F}\forall x(Q(x)\to \neg R(x))\\
  \text{with }\forall x(\neg R(x)\to \neg S(x))&\myrightarrow{\text{Hypothetical syllogism}}\forall x(Q(x)\to \neg S(x))\\
  &\myrightarrow{\begin{align*}\text{only }(T,T),Q(x)\to \neg S(x)=F\\\Rightarrow \text{only }(T,T),\neg Q(x)\vee \neg S(x)=F\end{align*}}\forall x\neg Q(x)\vee \neg S(x)\\
  \text{similarly,} \forall x\neg P(x)\vee S(x)&\\
  \text{then} &\myrightarrow{\text{Resolution}}\forall x\neg P(x)\vee\neg Q(x)\\
  &\myrightarrow{}\forall xP(x)\to \neg Q(x)
  \end{align*}
  $$
- [x] 24 3->4
- [ ] 26 by definition.
- [ ] 28 similar to 26
  *based on any variable* $a$
  then $(\neg(\neg P(a)\wedge Q(a)))\vee R(a)$, i.e. 
  $(P(a)\vee \neg Q(a))\vee R(a)$
  since only one of $Q(a)$ and $\neg Q(a)$ can be true, 
  then either $P(a)$ or $P(a)\vee R(a)$ is true.
  so $P(a)\vee R(a)$, i.e. $\neg R(a)\to P(a)$ is true.
  - The ans takes $\neg R(a)$ as the precise same as one of exercise before.
- [ ] 32
  TODO IMHO how the tautology proved without $p\wedge\neg p\equiv F$
  ~~it is same as to prove $F\vee(p\wedge\neg p)$~~
- [ ] 34
  D(x): x is difficult
  L(x): many students like x
  E(x): x is easy
  1. $D(logic)\vee \neg L(logic)$
  2. $E(mathematics) \to \neg E(logic)$
  a,~~b~~,d, T
  ~~c~~,e F
  - b. ~~-> $\neg D(logic)$,~~
    ~~but both $T\to T$ and $F\to T$ is possible, so~~
    $F\to T/F$, so $D(logic)$ is not determined, so nothing can be determined.
  - c same as b.
  - ~~-> $D(logic)$~~
    e $E(mathematics) \to \neg E(logic)$ -> $\neg E(mathematics) \vee \neg E(logic)$
    so the result is always T
    then $F/T \to T$ always holds.
- [x] 35
  p: Superman were able to prevent evil
  q: Superman were willing to prevent evil
  r: Superman would do so
  s: Superman would be malevolent
  t: Superman exists
  u: Superman is impotent

  1. $p\wedge q \to r$
  2. $\neg p \to u$
  3. $\neg q \to s$
  4. $\neg q$
  5. $t \to (\neg u\wedge\neg s)$
  if $t$, then $\neg s$ contray to $\neg q \to s$
  so $\neg t$.
### 1.7
Most of them are similar to proofs in the junior/senior high school.
- 2,4~6&10(similar to 2) skipped
- [ ] 8
  $p\wedge\neg q\to F$
  here $n=a^2,n+2=b^2$
  then $2=(a+b)(a-b)$
  $a+b=2\\ a-b=1$ 
  so $a=\frac{3}{2},b=\frac{1}{2}\Rightarrow a,b\notin \mathbb{Z}$, 
  obviously $F$
  - Also see ans where use the *consecutive* square to prove.

  a. from sorted one, each swap would decrease.

    a. "Without loss of generality," because we can swap among all $x_iy_i$ to keep $x_i$ sorted.
      the rest is same as above
    b. as the ans says, changing $y_i$ to the *increasing* order when $x_i$ increases will *increase* the sum, similarly, changing $y_i$ to the *decreasing* order when $x_i$ increases will *decrease* the sum.

  - after hint of FIGURE 7
    - the 1st line white mirrors to blue, etc, so not possible.

    - the 3rd, only (3,3) possible after both rotation and mirror.
      TODO constructive proof of (3,3).

  - ans

    a. is right
    b. is wrong.
- [ ] 52
  - ans use the same coloring as FIGURE 7
    then
    1. horizontal -> one color each
    2. vertical -> either zero or two squares of each color.
    ~~odd horizontal + even vertical ->~~
    - > assume without loss of generality that an even number of tiles are placed horizontally

      because rotation will swap horizontal with vertical.
      so "even number of horizontal" assumption is ok.
### Supplementary
Although "generally more difficult" said in p12, but it is not the case, at least for chapter 1.
- 2~8,38(contradiction or contraposition by the ans where they are same in the nature),44 skipped.
- [ ] 10
  1. if $q=T$, then all three is $T$ -> (A,A,A)
  2. $q=F$
     1. $p=T$, 1st is $F$ 
        2rd becomes $\neg r$ -> $T/F$ -> (R,A,R) / (R,R,R)
     2. $p=F$, 1st is $T$
        2rd becomes $F$ -> (A,R,R)
  - the ans seems to be wrong.
- [x] 12 because based on known propositional variables, the assertions $T/F$ are *fixed*.

  Anita must be knave because if she is knight, then contradiction with "I am a knave".

  b. all "if and only if" are by definition.

      \Rightarrow f^{-1}(S)={0,1,2},f^{-1}(T)={1,2,3},f^{-1}(S\cap T)={1,2}
      $$
      - compared with 42(b), 
        - here the function inherent property doesn't allow the **one-to-mul** mapping, so 
          $\nexists a\in S\cap\overline{T},b\in T\cap\overline{S},f^{-1}(a)=f^{-1}(b)$
          then nothing added to $f^{-1}(S\cap T)$ based on $f^{-1}(S)\cap f^{-1}(T)$
        - the 42(b) allows **mul-to-one** mapping, so 
          $\exists a\in S\cap\overline{T},b\in T\cap\overline{S},f(a)=f(b)$
          then maybe something added to $f(S\cap T)$ based on $f(S)\cap f(T)$

        implies possible stopping, also maybe all not stopping. (type 2)
        > This means that there are injections $f : A\to B$ and $g : B\to A$
        since their statuses are same. both A and B are possible to end at. (type 3,4)
  3. 1,4 is trivial because of existence
    - based on d,e. This function selection is due to
      1. type 4 with $g^{-1}(a)$ 
        is to select the end element $b\in B$ of type 4 when **onto**
      2. similarly type 3 must be with $f(a)$ to map the end element 
        $a\in A$.
      3. the rest can be either $f$ or $g$ because both side (forward/backward) can be run.
        This is also shown in [Schröder_Bernstein_theorem]
  4. by injection of $f$ 
    and partial function $g^{-1}$ (this line is hinted by the ans) <a id="injective_f_g_inverse"></a>

      \text{then }b\text{ is in two different chains, contradiction}\tag*{$\blacksquare$}
      $$
      - similar to e, since A can be always inside the chain (1,2,4) or at the end (3), so forward always works.
        i.e. use the injective property $f$
    - ~~since 3 has taken all $a$ in account, so $h(a)$ must exist without caring about whether $h(a)$ has its meaning,~~
      ~~which is different from 5 where it begins from $B$, so two cases must be separate to solve with.~~
      since one-to-one needs to prove $\forall x_1\neq x_2,h(x_1)\neq h(x_2)$, so no need to care about the detailed infos about 
      **what is exactly $x_1,x_2$**,
      but onto needs to prove $\forall y,\exists x,h(x)=y$ this needs **exact** equation of $x$ <a id="comparison_proof_onto_with_one_to_one"></a>
  5. type 4 is enough because $g$ is injective so **partial** function $g^{-1}$ is onto.
    ~~so p207 is based on the strict total function shown in p170 [default_total_function](#default_total_function)~~
    ~~> However, this is not the case because when you have an injection from a set A to a set B *that may not be onto*, and another injection from B to A that also may not be onto~~
    - the above is wrong because not use one same single function definition of $h$ with (d),(e)
      see the ans
    - the ans just use the chain locality
      where 1~3 doesn't ends with B, so backward or forward.
      4 ends with B, so the end is backwarded from $g(b)$ with $g^{-1}$ to get.

    - one-to-one
      1. if both $x_1,x_2\in S\vee x_1,x_2\in A-S$, then by [this](#injective_f_g_inverse), they are one-to-one
      2. WLOG, if $x_1\in S,x_2\in A-S$, suppose $f(x_2)=g^{-1}(x_1)\in T$ then $x_2$ should be in $S$ because it is mapped to $T$, contradiction
        - This is wrong, although this contradiction is right, but the above $g^{-1}$ is wrong because it has priority of <a id="care_about_construction_of_func"></a>
          $g^{-1}$ over $f$ and doesn't make sure that they don't overlap.
          See [Schröder_Bernstein_theorem] example [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6der%E2%80%93Bernstein_theorem#Examples) where $C_k$ ensures non-overlap which is just ~~B~~A-stopper because it can only starts from $[0,1]$ which is f domain.
          ~~This implies A/B-stopper has the priority over the doubly infinite.~~
      with 1,2 $\blacksquare$
    - onto
      $g^{-1}$ is enough to map to all $B$.
      ~~this also shows that the above $f(x)$ is **fake** which can't happen here.~~
    - here we can also use the graph similar to [2_3_37] to help understanding this problem.
  - this one is same as [wikipedia][Schröder_Bernstein_theorem]
    - TODO meaning
      > each a in A and b in B is in exactly one such sequence to within identity
    - the book problem definitions of A-stopper and B-stopper are same as here where both cares about the **very beginning** one.
    - it shows bijection by using partial $f^{-1}$ and 
      $f$
      > between its elements in A and **its** elements in B.
      - so with *all* three cases, then the *partial* ones can be combined to get the *onto* although this isn't said explicitly.
    - the figure shows onto with $a\sim f$

  as the problem says, p172 definition 4 use the same $f$ for different domains,i.e. both $A\to B$ and $\forall S\subset A \exists T\subset B,S\to T$
  the following ~~is based on that *both domains conform to* the one-to-one property of $f$, etc,~~ ~~which is trivial due to $f(S)=f(\cup s_i)=\cup f(s_i)=\cup t_i=T$~~ ~~see~~ a,b proves that $f(x):A\to B$ and $S_f(X) = f(X)$ have the **same** property w.r.t. one-to-one and onto where they use only the property of 
  $f(x)$ but not $f(X)$.
  a. let $X=\cup a_i$
    then $S_f(X)=f(X)=f(\cup a_i)=\cup b_i$
    - see the ans which focus on one specific element.
  
  b. $\forall X_2\exists X_1,f(X_2)=X_1=S_f(X_2)\blacksquare$
    - better see the ans where doesn't use the **direct generalization** the onto to the function of one *set*
    - $ X = \{ x \subset A | f(x) \subset Y \}$ implies $S_f (X) \in Y\Rightarrow S_f (X) \subset Y$
      - $ X = \{ x \subset A | f(x) \subset Y \}$
        it is due to the onto property, so each $f(x)$
        must have at least one corresponding $x$
        - but see p186 definition, it allows more than one $x$.
      - here doesn't imply because if $f(x)$ is not onto, then
        $\exists y\in Y,\nexists x\in A\ni f(x)=y$
        which is just what the $ Y \subseteq S_f (X)$ says.
    - here there is no way for $f(x)=Y$ to be in the set definition $ X = { x \in A | f(x) \in Y }$ 
      since the problem only shows "f is a function from A to B" but not "f is a function from $\mathcal{P}(A)$
      to $\mathcal{P}(A)$", 
      so the domain w.r.t. $x$ and $X$ are **not same**.
    - $S_f(a)=f(a)=b\wedge a\in X\Rightarrow b\in S_f(X)$
  
  c. ~~TODO $f^{-1}$ may not exist if not one-to-one correspondence.~~
    - the ans
      See p186 where the definition is "precisely *all preimages* of all elements of S".
      So $a\in S_{f^{-1}}(Y_1)=f^{-1}(Y_1)$ means a is one **preimage** of 
      $b\in Y$.
      - $Y_1\neq Y_2\Rightarrow f^{-1}(Y_1)\neq f^{-1}(Y_2)\Rightarrow S\subset Y_1-Y_2\ldots?$
      - The onto ensures $f^{-1}(Y_1-Y_2)\neq\varnothing\Rightarrow f^{-1}(Y_2+(Y_1-Y_2))=f^{-1}(Y_1)\neq f^{-1}(Y_2)$
      - intuitively but not strict (at least for the uncountable infinite set)
        $f:A\to B\text{ is onto}\Rightarrow |A|\ge|B|\Rightarrow |B|\le|A|\Rightarrow f^{-1}:B\to A\text{ is one-to-one}$

    - the ans
      ${u \in A |f(u) \in {f(x) |x \in X }}$ is based on one-to-one property because $Y = {f(x) | x \in X }$ maps each 
      $x$ to one unique $f(x)$, similarly for the former, each 
      $f(u)$ is mapped to one unique $u$, so one-to-one

    1. then if $\{x+y\}\in(0,1]$ then round up one
      both $\{y\}$ and $\{x\}$ will round up one -> $\neq$

  the left side is $\lfloor\frac{\lfloor 2n+2\epsilon\rfloor}{2}\rfloor=\lfloor\frac{2n\text{ or }2n+1}{2}\rfloor=n$
- [x] 26
  similar to 20,
  $x=k+\epsilon,\epsilon\in[0,1)$
  then it is to prove $t=n+k,\lfloor \frac{t+\epsilon}{m}\rfloor=\lfloor \frac{t}{m}\rfloor$
  since $m\ge 1\gt\epsilon\Rightarrow\frac{\epsilon}{m}\in[0,1)$
  to make $\frac{t}{m}$ to round up *another* one based on $\lfloor\frac{t}{m}\rfloor$, we need at least $\frac{1}{m}\gt\frac{\epsilon}{m}$, then it is impossible. $\blacksquare$
- [ ] 27
  similar to 20
  $\text{let }x=n+\epsilon,\epsilon\in[0,1),m\epsilon\in[k,k+1),\text{where }k\in\mathbb{N}\wedge k\in[0,m-1]$
  left side: $mn+k$
  right side: $\text{to let }\lfloor x+\frac{i}{m}\rfloor=\lfloor \frac{mn+m\epsilon+i}{m}\rfloor\text{ round up based on} n$
  we need $m\epsilon+i\ge m\Rightarrow k+i\ge m,i\ge m-k$, since $i$ stop at $n-1$ so there are $k$ right terms rounding up.$\blacksquare$

  To make one stable matching, try matching at least one side the highest rank, e.g. $(m_1,w_3),(m_2,w_1),(m_3,w_2)$.
  To make one not stable, just do the opposite, e.g. $(m_1,w_2),(m_2,w_3),(m_3,w_1)$
  - The ans
    for $(m_1,w_1),(m_2,w_3),(m_3,w_2)$ ~~is stable because~~ 
    $w_1,m_3$ has their most preferred match.
    Then to find the non-stable pair
    - $m_1$ must choose $w_3$ because it is the only one before $w_1$ but $w_3$ can't choose $m_1$ due to that it is the last.
    - TODO $m_2$ can only choose $w_2$ because $w_1$ is already satisfied, and $w_2$ also prefers $m_2$. So it is not stable
      The ans only takes in account 3 man/woman but not 6.

      - > Firstly, you need to find the maximum, since one cannot be sure some element is the second maximum without knowing which element is the maximum
        this may be trivial because second is based on first. So $n-1$ which is the worst/largest.

        then p5 is to make as more matches as possible, although the [best case](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13170419/21294350) is also $O(n)$.
        TODO see the graph or others where the best and worst differ.

          $$
          \left\lceil\frac{\lceil\frac{n}{2}\rceil}{2}\right\rceil=
          \left\lceil\frac{\frac{n}{2}+0\text{ or }\frac{1}{2}}{2}\right\rceil=

        - similar to the best pick among $n$ candidates, the best pick among $\lceil \lg n \rceil$ candidates to decide the second best, we **at least** need $\lceil \lg n \rceil-1$.
        - IMHO, here $\lceil \lg n \rceil$ losers to the best need to be bookkept for the following comparison.
    2. lower bound
      > Let the number of elements that lost to the maximum be m.
      The needed comparison:
      - either best ($n-1$) -> second ($m-1$)
      - or second ($n-2$) -> best ($m$ based on the assumption).
    3. $m\ge\lceil \lg n \rceil$ because at least $m$ at most is $n-1$.
      See the above or [second_largest_element_Adversary] p13 for the following:
      > with each comparison any weight can only double
      - > otherwise B says anything that does not disturb past answers
        i.e. it is impossible.
    4. The above process already shows that the worst case is possible.

    - ~~TODO~~ [medium][lec_13_parenthesis_theorem_Adversary_Arguments]
      - here the upper and lower bound in p5 should be the supremum and the Infimum.
        the lower bound is related with [$\Omega$](https://www-student.cse.buffalo.edu/~atri/cse331/support/lower-bound/index.html), similar upper with $O$.
        so upper bound only needs to prove existence as the above shows.
        - > the adversary sets that bit to whatever value will make the algorithm do the most work
          so the lower bound decided by the *adversary* argument **depends on the specific algorithm**.
        - Notice it is still based on worst cases, see [above](#worst_lower_bound).
      - Here in p6 proof of lemma 1 is based on
        1. It assumes the decision tree chooses the medium **without** knowing "elements smaller than the median", and then proves the contradiction.
          > Our decision tree gives the *wrong* answer for this *‘swapped’* input.
          i.e. after swapping the unknown comparison $(x_i,x_m)$, it is **still consistent** with "comparisons that we’ve already performed", but it is wrong.
        2. The choices of the "comparisons that we’ve already performed" implies the adversary argument.
      - > at least $2^{\frac{n}{2}−1}$ leaves
        - here it takes all nodes in account although some are [not leaves](https://yourbasic.org/algorithms/binary-search-tree/)
        - see [this p3](https://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/notes/12-lowerbounds.pdf), it means at least does $\frac{n}{2}−1$ comparison.
      - $\binom{n}{\frac{n}{2}-1}2^{\frac{n}{2}−1}$ is based on connecting all pruned trees to the corresponding leaves of the choice tree of the set L.

    - Also see [the table](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~chandra/documents/6363/lbd.pdf) where the number indicates the information number
  - compared with 7, the latter needs to traverse all items to find the minimum, so it takes more than here.
  - In summary, the proof is based on proving **both** the upper and the lower bound to one specific number
    with 7 in [lec_13_parenthesis_theorem_Adversary_Arguments] and 8 in [lower_bound_second_largest_element] with a bit different algorithms.

      suppose the stable pair $(w,m)$ is broken and 
      $(w,m'),m'>m\text{ for }w$ with $(w',m),w>w'\text{ for }m$, then $(w,m')$ is better than $(w,m)$, so no unstable pair is created.
- [ ] 34 WLOG

  1. ~~Here assume the men are the priority as original~~
    ~~so~~ based on original definition, we add that for matched pairs $(m,w)$, if existing some new pair 
    $(m',w)$, the **unchanging** side $w$ prefers $m'$ to $m$,
    then the original pair is unstable.
  2. same as original and finish when the *less* gender completed the match. (here only the finished condition changes)
  3. proof is same as the original.
  - see the ans
    - the b "*fictitious* people" **bridges the gap**, so the following can directly use the original method.
      1. "at the bottom of everyone’s preference lists" corresponds to "prefers any mate to being *unmatched*" (this definition is trivial based on the **assumption** which is also reasonable).
        women choose fictitious people -> unmatched
      - Then the following original conditions are met:
        1. same number of men and women
        2. ranks, i.e. preference in all cases.
      - so direct use the original proof
- [ ] 36

        here assume k is the **first** refused so k chooses worse $(k,k_s'),k_s'<k_s\text{ for }k$ while k_s chooses better $(k_s,l)$.
        since $l$ is not refused implied by the above first, so l also prefers $k_s$ to $l_s$, contradiction.
      - TODO why theorem 4 based on the recursive version can choose *all* possible when only choosing only man $\ge i$.
        or more specifically, why rule 2 thinks of $j<i$ as unsuccessful.
      - The recursive theorem just loops one man , one woman instead of all men, all women as 3.1-65.

    the requiring time of the past jobs will overlap the following deadlines.
    so maybe:
    (requiring time, slackness): (30,10); (1,11); ...
- [ ] 40
  1. proof of the hint:
     TODO no idle time
     ~~is~~ ~~trivial~~, e.g. "(requiring time, deadline): (14,20), (1,10)" where 2nd will be late.
  2. since the lateness is $l_i=d_i-\sum_{k=1}^{i}r_k$ 
    (here use the initial of related terms to indicate the variable)
    the when $d_i$ is big, the $\sum$ should also be big to let the $l_i$ less.
    - here prove that this is also optimal, i.e. it will the possibility that lateness will be negative lowest.
      This is equivalent to prove that if the above scheduling $S$ has one negative lateness, then no other scheduling $S'$ can have all positive lateness.
      Suppose $s_i$ in $S$ has the negative lateness,
      1. if swap $s_i$ with $s_m,m<i$ (here order comparison is based on the order in $S$)
        then $l_m'=d_m'-\sum_{k=1}^{m'}r_k=d_m-\sum_{k=1}^{i}r_k<l_i<0$, then still one negative lateness.
      2. if swap $s_i$ with $s_m,m>i$
        similarly, $l_i'=d_i-\sum_{k=1}^{m}r_k<l_i<0$
      Based on the induction of the above process, $S$ can't be modified to $S'$. $\blacksquare$

    - How it is related with this question.
      - lemma 2 implies after $2n-3$ calls, at most $n-1$ F-points are constructed.
        So we need **at least** $2n-4$ to get n F-points.
    - proof
      - > This  is   impossible  since  |E1| + l<k.
        more intuitively, at least k-1 edges more are needed to make isolated $x$ F-point.
        But $|E_1|=k-2<k-1$
      - > If  c(n+k—  p—3) is  not  adjacent  to  any  F-point,
        this interchanges $c(n+k—  p—3)$ with 
        $ c(n + k—p—2),\ldots, c(n +  k—4)$
      - here component implies [disjoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_(graph_theory)) <a id="component_inherent"></a>
        so the sequence 3 can be constructed by interchanging $\bar{\bar{c}}(i)$ with 
        $\bar{c}(1),\ldots,\bar{c}(r)$
      - here lemma 1 is proved by graph because
        one line connecting all $n$ points must have at least $n-1$ edges.
      - > the first n—3 calls can be equivalently re-ordered so that the (n—3)-rd call is in a different component of G0 to c(n—2)
        if (n-3)rd already meets the requirement, then nothing needs to be done.
        if not, then suppose the $k$th meets the requirement, then interchange it with $(n-3)$rd, we are done.
      - > In fact, we can assume that $p<k$. For, ifp=k we can, by the last paragraph
        This is due to that the interchange can make the last $p—1$ calls "all between F-points".
      - ~~TODO the proof may be Begging the question~~
        ~~because~~
        > Suppose there are k F-points after the n+k—4 calls
        the above which has been proven available by the book ans is different from ~~what to be proved~~ the following
        > This shows that there can be *at most* k F-points.
      - > Therefore, by the induction hypothesis there must be exactly k—r such F-points
        TODO IMHO this is based on hypothesis
        > Suppose there are k F-points after the n+k—4 calls
        
        similarly
        > there is an equivalent re-ordering of these n+k—r—4 calls so that the last k—r are between the k—r .F-points not in C
        this is just based on the hypothesis of what to be proved "... in which the last k calls".
      - > In fact, we can assume that $p<k$ ...
        It can be ignored which doesn't influence the proof.
      - In summary

Then each new added **arc plane** caused by intersection (similar to "the number of regions into which the previous $n−1$ planes divides plane $n$" in the above comment) between two spheres will divide the region the arc plane is inside.
    So we can also have the following equations for the sphere version:
    $$
    R_2(0)=1,R_2(n)=n^2−n+2,n\ge 1\\
    R_3(n)-R_3(n-1)=R_2(n-1),n\ge 1

    > the number of regions added by plane $n$ is the number of regions split by plane $n$ which is the number of regions into which the previous $n−1$ planes divides plane $n$
    "the number of regions split by plane $n$" is equivalent to "plane $n$ is *splitted into regions*".
    So just think as plane $n$ is fixed, then "the previous $n−1$ planes" interset with plane $n$,
    > any three of these planes have exactly one point in common
    this implis no plane pairs are parallel, then every plane will interset with plane n with one lines,
    so it becomes **$n-1$ lines**, <a id="R_3_divided_by_planes"></a>
    then "three of these planes have exactly one point" becomes "two of these lines have exactly one point"
    This exactly means that $n-1$ lines split the plane $n$ into $R_2(n−1)$ regions.

    the latter case is due to that we must append 0, so the last 3 of the first ${n-1}$ bits must be 
    $100$ where $00$ is to ensure $000$ after appending and $1$ is to ensure no $000$ in $a_{n-1}$.

    Here we use $W$ to denote win.

      - Here we can start from B(0,1), obviously it can't end early <a id="beginning_step"></a>
        then similar for B(0,2) (even with A(3,0), it still can't end early)
        - Here B(0,3) becaue B(0,2) may have (3,2) ending, similar for (0,4).
          A:(3,2) ~~can only contain 2 $L$ after 3 $W$ which is contained in A(2,2),B(0,4)~~ is impossible to be with B(0,3) since $3+2>0+3+1$ 
        - A:(3,1) where 1 $L$ after 3 $W$ is contained in A(3,0),B(0,3)
          So here we have only $C_{2}^3$
      - B(0,4), then A should minus one win, so A(2,2), otherwise it will duplicate.
        - When A(2,2),B(0,3), B may end with B(2,3), so we need one more, then B(0,4)
    - Notice when B changes from B(0,3) to B(0,4)
      - A should win ~~more or equally,~~ less, otherwise it will be duplicate.
        Then if A(2,x), then $2+x=0+4\text{ or }0+4+1$
        The rest is similar.
      - A can't win less than $2$, because $1+4=5$ then it can't end early.
      - It can be **generalized** to the rest.
    - Notice here we can always try from the 1st try to the 2nd try based on the specific B state.
      e.g. from A(3,0) to A(3,1) based on B(0,3).
      It can be **generalized** to the rest.
    2. Team B scores 1 goal
      - B(1,2) similar to [the above](#beginning_step)
        since $4=1+2+1$ so we can't let A win less.
    - Notice here B(1,3),A(3,1) relation with B(0,3),A(3,1)
      here one $W$ after 3 $L$ will be duplicate with B(0,3),A(3,1) where A has **one un-shadowed tick and one more shot than B**, then it is disallowed. <a id="shadow_move"></a>
      It can be **generalized** to the rest.
  - B win
    Notice since the order matters, so we can't just mirror the above "A win" case to here.
    - The above basic idea can still apply to here.
    1. Team A does not score goals
      - here when A(0,3), B(0,3) can't lose more
      - Notice here
        the conversion from A(0,4),B(2,1) to A(0,4),B(2,2) should be similar to 
        the conversion from A(1,3),B(3,0) to A(1,3),B(3,1).
    2. Team A scores 1 goal
      - with A(1,3),B(3,1)
        here we can let A win whichever goal without influencing the final result.
    - similar to [above](#shadow_move), 
      compare A(0,3),B(3,0) with A(1,3),B(3,0) where in the former case, A and B shot with the same count, then we can **precede** A with one tick.
      It can be **generalized** to the rest.
    - compare A(1,3),B(3,0) with A(1,3),B(3,1)
      we can always **precede one cross** before B when make A temporarily fixed.
      It can be **generalized** to the rest.
    3. Team A scores 2 goals
      - The conversion from A(0,3),B(3,0) to A(1,3),B(3,0) where in the latter case when the last tick is put at the last it will be duplicate with the former case **isn't similar to** 
        the conversion from A(1,3),B(3,0) to A(2,2),B(4,0) where in the latter case when one of the two ticks is put at the last it won't be duplicate with the former case since the last one goal of A in A(1,3),B(3,0) is **lost (i.e. cross symbol)**
        - We should also differentiate the above the conversion from A(1,3),B(3,0) to A(2,2),B(4,0) from the similarity between
          the conversion from A(1,3),B(3,1) to A(2,3),B(3,1) where where in the latter case when the last tick is put at last it will be duplicate with the former case. <a id="duplicate_when_ending_tick"></a>
      - check duplicate situations with [this](#check_order)
        A(2,2),B(4,0):check A when A is changed. Then when A is different, there is no need to check B.
        A(2,3),B(3,1):check A when A is re-changed.
        A(2,3),B(3,2):check B when B is changed based on the above change sequence.
    - Obviously we should try from A(2,1) otherwise even if B all wins as A, it can't end early.
      It can be **generalized** to the rest.
    - We can just increase A lost goal count when fixing its win goal.
      Then B should win more than A starting from $3$. More specifically, it should start from `A_win+A_left_round+1`
      It can be **generalized** to the rest.
    - Here when checking whether B can select all possible locations without fixing one, <a id="check_order"></a>
      it *only* needs to check inside the *current* fixed A state possibilities, because it will always be different from other rest cases due to differences of A.
      - But When checking A, it needs to check *other* A states. See [this](#duplicate_when_ending_tick).
      It can be **generalized** to the rest.
  - Draw
    ~~Here when A with $i$ goals won, to make A win, then B must lose at sometime~~
    This has been implicitly proven in the above due to `(A_score>B_round+B_score) or (B_score>A_round+A_score)`, 
    so they can't have same ticks (scores) even after filling the left un-kicked goals of one side with ticks.
    More specifically
    > both teams must score the same amount of penalties at the end of the shoot-out.
    has nothing in common with the above situations where A or B wins.

       This can be seen from the similarity between proof of THEOREM 3 and EXAMPLE 8.
       - in THEOREM 3, we **don't care about the order** among type $1\sim k$, so no $k!$.
         Also in THEOREM 4, we **don't care about the order** among DISTINGUISHABLE BOXES.

  - $4*\frac{4^{\overline{7}}}{(2!)^4}$ is wrong (here use [rising factorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling_and_rising_factorials) notation)
    because here $4$ is to choose the intermediate number between two Xes which **cares about** the number type,
    but $\frac{4^{\overline{7}}}{(2!)^4}$ doesn't care about 
    where it only considers duplicate inside $aa$ or $bb$ but doesn't consider the duplicate like $XaabbX$ whne choosing $a$ or $b$ for the above $4$.
    ```bash
    1. select a first:
    Xa   X
    Xaa  X
    Xaab X
    XaabbX

    Or duplicately by selecting b first:

    X   bX
    X  bbX
    X abbX
    XaabbX

    2. /2! only cares about:
    X aX
    XaaX

    with

    Xa X
    XaaX
    ```
    This duplicate is not trivial since it has different duplicate size like 4 for $aabb$ or 6 for $aabbcc$.
    So this method is maybe too complex.
    - For THEOREM 3, the above problem doesn't exist
      because it can be seen as location selection of $aabbcc\dots XX$ one by one from left to right. Then divide by $2!$ sequentially due to overcount $aa,bb,cc$ instead of something like $aabb$.

  let $f$ be the map from permutation to "nonnegative integers less than n!."
  - then obviously $a_{k-1}\le k-1$ due to "less than k" which corresponds to "$a_i$ ... not exceeding i". So *onto*. This implies $f$ is valid because unique map into "nonnegative integers less than n!." due to uniqueness of each $a_{k-1}$.
  - $f^{-1}$ is done as the following:
    - basis step: $a_1$ implies the relation between $2$ and $1$ where $a_1=0\to 12;\text{ and }a_1=1\to 21$
    - induction step: Then based on $a_i,i\le k$ deciding **uniquely** all numbers $1\to (k+1)$,
    $a_{k+1}$ also inserts **uniquely** $k+1$ into these $k+1$ numbers which has $k+2$ choices.

    so for "every collection of fewer than m(d) sets each contain-ing d elements", when $d=2$ and there are 2 sets $A,B$, if $A\cap B= \varnothing$ then we just assign each set with different colors and there is **no contradiction** when $A\cup B$. Then if $A\cap B=\{k\}$ we can assign 
    $B-\{k\}=A-\{k\}$, then still **no contradiction**.
    - contradiction condition:
      take {1,2},{2,3},{1,3} for example.
      ~~since {1,2},{2,3} must take 2 colors in each subset, so {A,B},{B,A} where A,B are R,B or B,R (R:Red,B:Blue). Then {1,3} will only have one color.~~
      let 1->R,2->B
      then {2,3} makes 3->R
      {1,3} makes 3->B, then **contradiction** which is caused by one element is assigned **different colors by different sets**.
  - Here "fewer than m(d)" implies if $m(d)=k$ fails then $m(d)>k$ also fails.
    - Also if "every collection of $t$ sets" succeeds then "every collection of $t'$ sets 
      ($t'<t$)" also succeeds where the latter is **subsets** of the former.

    - odds form is just derived from Bayes' theorem

    - > the odds against door 1 hiding the car were 2 : 1.
      Richard Gill cares about only 2 cases where $2$ corresponds to "door 1" doesn't hide the car.

        - > 'the probability of door 1 was $\frac{1}{3}$ and *nothing can* change that ...' is automatically fishy: probabilities are expressions of our ignorance about the world, and new information can change the extent of our ignorance.
          IMHO, in this specific case, $\frac{1}{3}$ is indeed unchanged.
        - > $\frac{1}{3}$ must be the average probability that the car is behind door 1 given the host picked door 2 and given the host picked door 3 because these are the only two possibilities
          - Notice the above is based on
            > behind door 1, the door initially chosen by the player,
            so the following $p_{12}$ can be 
            $\frac{1}{2}$ and $p_{32}=1$.
          - this corresponds ot the [paper](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.1991.10475821)
          $\frac{\frac{p_{12}}{p_{12}+p_{22}+p_{32}}+\frac{p_{13}}{p_{13}+p_{23}+p_{33}}}{2}$
          when $p_{12}=p=\frac{1}{2}$ the above becomes 
          $\frac{1}{3}$.
          - This also implies

  - since the largest is always at the bottom,

    - similar to EXAMPLE 2, the 1st $a_{n-1}$ steps are necessary to move the 
      $n$th (Here can't move to the 2nd peg because it will **disallow the $n$th to move**.)
      - similarly, the 2nd $a_{n-1}$ steps also can't be to the 2nd peg to **allow the $n$th to move**.
      - the 3rd $a_{n-1}$ steps are trivial to finish the final goal.
      - Here is based on the *goal peg* to calculate the *least* steps needed.
  - notice here $a_{n-1}$ is to move to the 3rd peg instead of the 2nd.

    - notice here we [can't differentiate](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/279489/1059606) w.r.t. $i$ because it is discrete.
      It is different from [series w.r.t. $x$](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/m408s/CurrentWeb/LM11-9-4.php) which is continuous.
      - Similar to [this](https://math.stackexchange.com/a/129306/1059606)
        - generally, $S(t)=\sum_{k=1}^n k^m t^k$
          we can get $(1-t)S(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} [((k+1)^m-k^m) t^{k+1}]- n^m t^{n+1}$
          the $((k+1)^m-k^m)$ will become more complex.
        - For this problem,
          let $S(k)=\sum_{i=1}^{k} i2^{i-1}$
          then $(1-2)S(k)=\sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{i-1} -k\cdot 2^{k}\Rightarrow S(k)=(k-1)2^k+1=(k+1)2^k-2^{k+1}+1$ 
    - $k<\sqrt{2n+\frac{1}{4}}+\frac{1}{2}\xRightarrow{\sqrt{2n+\frac{1}{4}}<\sqrt{2n}+\frac{1}{2}\text{ got by square both sides}}k<\sqrt{2n}+1$
    - $(1+\sqrt{2n}+1)2^{1+\sqrt{2n}}=(4+2\sqrt{2n})2^{\sqrt{2n}}<6\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{n}2^{\sqrt{2n}}$ here is based on $n\to \infty$ implied by $O(\dots)$
- [ ] 50
  - we can also use iterative method that $\triangledown^k a_{n-1}=\triangledown^k a_{n}-\triangledown^{k+1} a_{n}$ although more complex.
    Then based on $a_{n-k-1}=a_{n-k}-\triangledown a_{n-k}$,
    So to make 
    $\triangledown a_{n-k}$ as the polynomial of $\sum t_m\triangledown^m a_{n}$, we need 
    $k$ iterative raise of $m$ in $\triangledown^m a_{n}$, i.e. we need at most 
    $\triangledown^{1+k} a_{n}$ based on raising $1$ by $k$ to $1+k$.

- [ ] 54 see [codes](./miscs_snippets/py_codes/8-1-53/max_attendee.py)
- [ ] 56
  - c) based on $M(1)=a_1$, then calculate all later $M(k),k=2,\dots,n$, then the max is $max_{k=1}^n(M(k))$
  - e) similar to one example, if saving the $M(k)$ values, then each 
    $M(k)$ has only one addition due to $M(k-1)+a_k$ and one comparison $max(M(k-1)+a_k,a_{k})$.
    then $n-1$ totally, then 
    $max_{k=1}^n(M(k))$ has another $n-1$ comparisons.
    so addition: $n-1$ and comparison: $2(n-1)$.
  - Notice here the Dynamic programming is just [recursive **nested**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#History) algorithm. Compared with ["Divide and conquer"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divide-and-conquer_algorithm#Divide_and_conquer) which has no overlap, i.e. the result *can't be easily reused*/nested, so we needs **conquer**.
  - see the ans
    - c)
      > the starting point of the string of numbers ending at position k that achieves the maximum sum
      since "the starting point" is shared by many $M(k)$. Then to construct 
      $M(k)$, we can just list all strings starting same as $M(k)$ and list their ending numbers in the order by the index of 
      $M(k)$.
    - IMHO c) in the ans only does the part to get $max_{1\le j\le k \le n} \sum_{i=j}^k a_i$
    - e) is more quick to prove $O()$ without getting the exact operation number.
- [ ] 57
  - b) if not optimal and use way $K$, then we must be able to use the optimal way to be better.
    - The above is wrong because it doesn't show the relation with the *whole operation number*. see the ans
  - d) notice here it is wrong to direct be based on the c) formula pattern.
    ```python
    for i:=1~n:
      M(i,i)=0
    for i:=1~n:
      for j:= i+1~n:
        M(i,j)=infinite
        for k:=i~j-1:
          if M(i,k)+ M(k + 1, j ) +m_i m_{k+1} m_{j+1}<M(i,j):
            M(i,j)=M(i,k)+ M(k + 1, j ) +m_i m_{k+1} m_{j+1}
    ```
    because the `M(k + 1, j )` will has no defined value when `i` is fixed while `j` and `k` becomes bigger, then the recurrence relation *can't apply*.
    - see the ans
      - here `d` controls the `k-i` range in `M(i,k)`.
      - error fix
        - $min \coloneqq 0$ should be $min \coloneqq +\infty$
        - `for k:=i to i+d` should be `for k:=i to i+d-1` to ensure the validity of `M(k+1,i+d)`.
          i.e. `k<j` in c).
      - the at each iteration of `d`
        `M(i,i+d)` will get all `M(,)` with difference `d`
        and `M(i,k)` and `M(k+1,i+d)` will only uses `M(,)` with difference *less than* `d`.
        So `M(i,k)` and `M(k+1,i+d)` are *always valid*.

    ~~because for the 2d x 2d square, each point in one d x d box only has to be compared with the adjacent ones, for the diagonal one, its distance is same as the adjacent~~
    this may be wrong. For example, let (0,0) center, $d=2$, then if the square having $(-2,-2)-(2,2)$ as its diagonal only covers 
    $(1,1),(-1,1),(-0.5,-0.5)$ then the diagonal box needs to be considered.

  - here 22,24 only has divide without conquer.
    See [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8850447/why-is-binary-search-a-divide-and-conquer-algorithm#comment39286287_8850447) from [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/algorithms/comments/14pndtv/comment/jqiwk5k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) "decrease and conquer" is only divide with the only single subproblem. Then *conquer* only occurs [once](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8850447/why-is-binary-search-a-divide-and-conquer-algorithm#comment11054614_8850447)

    - Then if we want to solve with $\{a_n\}$ directly.
      based on $x_n,y_n,z_n$ recurrence relations, $a_n$ contains $0\sim 3$ month-old rabbits after reproduction.
      Then $a_n$ should be at least $a_{n-1}-f_4$ where $f_4$ means rabbits 4 years old in $a_{n-1}$ at the $a_n$ step.
$$
\begin{align*}
  a_{n-1}:\\
  0,&1,&&2\\
  \downarrow\\
  1,&2,&&3\\
a_{n-3}\text{ after reproduction}:\\
&&&3,4,5\\
a_{n-2}\text{ after reproduction}:\\
&2,&&3,4\\
\end{align*}\\
\text{Here we want to calcluate based on the index }\\
(f_1+f_2)+\overbrace{f_2+f_3}^{\text{newborn}}=a_{n-1}-f_3+a_{n-2}-f_4\\
\text{here if not using }f_i\text{, it is difficult to calculate them based on }a_i\text{ because it will probably have one \textbf{long} recurrence relation sequence.}

  - > If the weights are real numbers ... then no efficient algorithm is known for solving the knapsack problem. Indeed, the problem is NP-complete
    See [this](https://qr.ae/pKSbqq)
    Here if real, then the bit length may be very long, so "no efficient".
    But if `int`, then $64$-bit may be very large which is enough. However, for double, some small digits after the decimal point can't be denoted.
    - The key idea is that the definition of [**"input size"**](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-meaning-of-pseudo-polynomial-time-complexity-I-saw-that-Knapsack-runs-in-pseudo-polynomial-time-I-read-about-this-here-Pseudo-polynomial-time-but-I-am-not-able-to-follow-I-want-to-understand-the-concept/answer/Nishanth-Dikkala) from [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3907545/how-to-understand-the-knapsack-problem-is-np-complete#comment48148457_3907545) <a id="Pseudo_polynomial"></a>
      so if it is $\log(N)$, then 
      $O(N)$ will becomes $O(2^{\log(N)})$ which is exponential not polynomial.
    - Also see this [example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27718369/21294350)
      > but as you double the size of W, it does not mean W=16, but the length will be twice longer:
      where `int` length twice longer will be multiply $2^{orig_len}$
      but for `double`, it may have exponent plus something like $2^{orig_len}$ then multiply 
      $2^{2^{orig_len}}$
```python
# c
"""
1. Here num is max_index of the list W.
2. weight > 0
"""
def M(num,weight,W):
  if num==0:
    if W[num]>weight:
      return 0
    else:
      return W[num]
  pop(W[num])
  if W[num]>weight:
    return M(num − 1, weight,W)
  else:
    new_weight=weight-W[num]
    return max(M(num − 1, weight,W),W[num]+M(num − 1, new_weight,W))
```
   - see the ans
    - c
      - compared with the above codes
        1. > they can be discarded before we start
        2. it begins from $M(1,w)$
          but it is not possible for the code although *after the nest*, it will calculate $M(1,w)$ first.
    - d is same as what I thought that based on iterative $M(j,w)-M(j-1,w)==0$.

  - [longest common subsequence (LCS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence#:~:text=A%20longest%20common%20subsequence%20(LCS,positions%20within%20the%20original%20sequences.) is used in `diff`
    It doesn't have the constraint of *continuity*.
    - Then all is trivial.
      - Notice here $c_p\neq a_m$ and $c_p\neq b_n$ may both occur
        then 2 items are excluded, so becomes $L(i − 1, j − 1)$.
- [ ] 17 see the ans
  - notice here we init $L(i, 0)$ and 
    $L(0, j)$ firstly.
    - since $i,j$ both increase, $L(i-1, j-1)$, etc, will always be valid.
- [ ] 18 see the ans
  Here in the ans it may be stored in global variable (because it calculates at the small step values firstly. If stored in the stack, it will probably *not be shared*.) similar to 14 where it uses the **stack** to store the recursive results.
  - Use `L(i, j) = L(i − 1, j − 1) + 1` to find the element
    and use `max (L(i, j −1), L (i − 1, j ))` to exclude elements and decrease the list size to finish the algorithm. (See 15 "2 items are excluded")
- [x] 20 see [this](#master_theorem)
- [ ] 22 see the ans
  - notice here $+2$ because two halves may *share* the largest number.
  - here should have initial case $f(1)$ instead of 
    only $f(2)$ because 
    $f(3)$ will be splitted into $f(1),f(2)$
  - > This algorithm could be made slightly more efficient by having the base cases be n = 2 and n = 3 , rather than n = 1
    This is similar to the [derangement_code].

```python
# this one may be wrong
# Here we doesn't need the assumption in ans d.
def unimodal(start,end,List):
  if end-start==1:
    return index(max(List[start],List[end]))
  mid=(start+end)//2 # >= (start+start+2)//2 >= start+1
  if List[mid]>List[start] and List[mid]>List[end]:
    m=index(max(unimodal(start,mid,List),unimodal(mid,end,List)))
  elif (List[mid]<List[start] and List[mid]<List[end]) or List[mid]==List[end] or (mid!=start and List[mid]==List[start]):
    print("not find")
  # the rest is in the range (List[start],List[end]) or (List[end],List[start])
  elif List[start]<List[end] and List[mid]<List[end]:
    m=unimodal(mid,end,List)
  elif List[start]>List[end] and List[mid]>List[end]:
    m=unimodal(start,mid,List)
```
  - see the ans
    - d. Here is based on the assumption that this sequence is *already one unimodal sequence*. Otherwise, it will always *drop the check of the strict increase/decrease* of one whole half which will incur errors if this sequence is not one unimodal sequence.
      - If not having this assumption, then probably $n$ complexity because we obviously *at least* need check every terms to ensure the strictly increase/decrease and it is *possible* by traversing the sequence.
      - It should be $a_m=max(a_i,a_j),j=i+1$ and $a_m=max(a_i,a_{\frac{i+j}{2}}a_j),j=i+2$
- [x] 28 is same as [Derivation_linear_constant_coefficient_recurrence_relation].
- [ ] 38
  - Since "less than", we should let $M=1,000,000-1$.
- [ ] 40 $\binom{4+3-1}{4-1}\cdot 4!$ is wrong where permutation should be inside each employee instead of all employees. See the code [Stirling_second_kind_code]
  - Here $3^4$  has no overcount because $(1,1,2,3)$ (here the 
    $i$th number $k$ means 
    $i$th job is assigned to $k$th employee) is only counted once.
- [ ] 42 similar to one exercise before
  $a_{n}=\sum_{i=1}^4 a_{n-i},a_i=2^i,i=0\sim 3$
  Use `f=lambda n: 2**n if n>=0 and n<=3 else sum([f(n-i) for i in range(1,4+1)])` to calculate `f(6)`
  $$
  0\ldots\\
  10\ldots\\
  110\ldots\\
  1110\ldots\\
  $$
  - The ans use inclusion-exclusion principle.
